# Deploy with Docker Compose

One of the simplest ways of either prototyping or serving in
production is to run your {class}`~jina.Flow` with `docker-compose`.

A {class}`~jina.Flow` is composed of {class}`~jina.Executor`s which run Python code
defined to operate on `DocumentArray`. These `Executors` will live in different runtimes depending on how you want to deploy
your Flow. 

By default, if you are serving your Flow locally they will live within processes. Nevertheless, 
because Jina is cloud native your Flow can easily manage Executors that live in containers and that are
orchestrated by your favorite tools. One of the simplest is Docker Compose which is supported out of the box. 

You can deploy a FLow with Docker Compose with one line:


```{code-block} python
---
emphasize-lines: 3
---
from jina import Flow
flow = Flow(...).add(...).add(...)
flow.to_docker_compose_yaml('docker-compose.yml')
```

Jina will generate a `docker-compose.yml` configuration file corresponding with your Flow. You can use this directly with 
Docker Compose, avoiding the overhead of manually defining all the services needed for the Flow.

````{admonition} Use docker based Executors
:class: caution
All Executors in the Flow should be used with `jinahub+docker://...` or `docker://...`.
````

````{admonition} Health check available from 3.1.3
:class: caution
If you use Executors that rely on Docker images built with a version of Jina prior to 3.1.3, remove the 
health check from the dumped YAML file, otherwise your Docker Compose services will 
always be "unhealthy."
````

````{admonition} Matching jina versions
:class: caution
If you change the Docker images in your Docker Compose generated file, ensure that all the services included in
the gateway are built with the same Jina version to guarantee compatibility.

## Example: Indexing and searching images using CLIPEncoder and ANNLiteIndexer

Install [`Docker Compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) locally to follow this how-to.

This example shows how to build and deploy a Flow with Docker Compose, using [`CLIPImageEncoder`](https://hub.jina.ai/executor/0hnlmu3q)
as an image encoder and [`ANNLiteIndexer`](https://hub.jina.ai/executor/7yypg8qk) as an indexer to perform fast nearest
neighbor retrieval on image embeddings.

### Deploy your Flow

First let's define the Flow and generate the Docker Compose YAML configuration from it

````{tab} YAML
In a `flow.yml` file :
```yaml
jtype: Flow
with:
  port: 8080
  protocol: http
executors:
- name: encoder
  uses: jinahub+docker://CLIPEncoder
  replicas: 2
- name: indexer
  uses: jinahub+docker://AnnLiteIndexer
  uses_with:
    dim: 512
  shards: 2
```
then in a shell do:
```shell
jina export docker-compose flow.yml docker-compose.yml 
```
````


````{tab} Python
In python run
```python
from jina import Flow

flow = (
    Flow(port=8080, protocol='http')
    .add(name='encoder', uses='jinahub+docker://CLIPEncoder', replicas=2)
    .add(
        name='indexer',
        uses='jinahub+docker://AnnLiteIndexer',
        uses_with={'dim': 512},
        shards=2,
    )
)
flow.to_docker_compose_yaml('docker-compose.yml')
```
````

````{admonition} Hint
:class: hint
You can use a custom jina Docker image for the Gateway service. Just set the envrironment variable `JINA_GATEWAY_IMAGE` to the desired image before generating the configuration.
````

let's take a look at the generated compose file:
```yaml
version: '3.3'
...
services:
  encoder-rep-0:  # # # # # # # # # # #          
                  #     Encoder       #
  encoder-rep-1:  # # # # # # # # # # #

  indexer-head:   # # # # # # # # # # #          
                  #                   #
  indexer-0:      #     Indexer       #
                  #                   #
  indexer-1:      # # # # # # # # # # #

  gateway: 
    ...
    ports:
    - 8080:8080
```

```{tip} 
:class: caution
The default compose file generated by the Flow contains no special configuration or settings. You may want to 
adapt it to your own needs.
```

Here you can see that 5 services will be created:

- 1 for the **Gateway** which is the entrypoint of the **Flow**.
- 2 associated with the encoder for the two Replicas.
- 3 associated with the indexer, one for the Head and two for the Shards.

Now, you can deploy this Flow :

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

### Query your Flow

Once we see that all the services in the Flow are ready, we can start sending index and search requests.

First let's define a client:
```python
from jina.clients import Client

client = Client(host='http://localhost:8080')
```

Then let's index the set of images we want to search:

```python
from docarray import DocumentArray

da = DocumentArray.pull('demo-da-images-jina', show_progress=True)

da_query = da[0:1]  # one document for query
da_index = da[1:]  # the rest is for indexing

indexed_docs = client.index(inputs=da_index)
print(f'Indexed Documents: {len(indexed_docs)}')
```

```shell
Indexed Documents: 99
```

We indexer 99 Documents !

Then let's search for the closest image to our query image:

```python
queried_docs = client.search(inputs=da_query)

matches = queried_docs[0].matches
print(f'Matched Documents: {len(matches)}')
```


```shell
Matched Documents: 10
```

Now have the list of the 10 closest image to the query !
