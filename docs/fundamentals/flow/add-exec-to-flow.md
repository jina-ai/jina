# Add Executor


`.add()` is the core method to add an Executor to a `Flow` object. Each `add` creates a new Executor, and these
Executors can be run as a local thread/process, a remote process, inside a Docker container, or even inside a remote
Docker container.

```{tip}

You can see the exhaustive list of options for adding an Executor [here](https://docs.jina.ai/cli/#executor).
```


## Chain `.add()`

Chaining `.add()`s creates a sequential Flow.

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add().add().add().add()
```

```

## Define Executor via `uses`

`uses` parameter to specify the Executor.

`uses` accepts multiple value types including class name, Docker image, (inline) YAML.
Therefore, you can add an executor via:

````{tab} Class Name

```python
from jina import Flow, Executor


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    ...


f = Flow().add(uses=MyExecutor)

with f:
    ...
```
````

`````{tab} YAML file
`myexec.py`:

```python
from jina import Executor


class MyExecutor(Executor):

    def __init__(self, bar, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__()
        self.bar = bar

    ...
```

`myexec.yml`

```yaml
jtype: MyExecutor
with:
  bar: 123
metas:
  name: awesomeness
  description: my first awesome executor
  py_modules: myexec.py
requests:
  /random_work: foo
```

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add(uses='myexec.yml')

with f:
    ...
```

````{admonition} Note
:class: note
YAML file can be also inline:

```python
from jina import Flow

f = (Flow()
     .add(uses='''
jtype: MyExecutor
with:
  bar: 123
metas:
  name: awesomeness
  description: my first awesome executor
requests:
  /random_work: foo    
    '''))
```
````
`````

````{tab} Dict
```python
from jina import Flow
from jina import Executor

class MyExecutor(Executor):
    ...

f = Flow().add(
    uses={
        'jtype': 'MyExecutor',
        'with': {'bar': 123}
    })
```
````

### Executor discovery
By default, the Flow will attempt to retrieve the Executors' source files and YAML config files from the working 
directory and other paths set in the `PATH` environment variable. If your Executor's source files and YAML config are 
located elsewhere, you can specify their locations using the parameter 
`extra_search_paths`.

For example, suppose we have the following project structure where `app/` represents the working directory:
```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ñ∂ main.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ executor
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_executor.py
```
`executor/my_executor.py`:
```python
from jina import Executor, DocumentArray, requests

class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        pass
```

`executor/config.yml`:
```yaml
jtype: MyExecutor
metas:
  py_modules:
    - executor.py
```

Now, in `app/main.py`, to correctly load the Executor, you can specify the directory of the Executor like so:
```{code-block} python
---
emphasize-lines: 2
---
from jina import Flow, Document
f = Flow(extra_search_paths=['../executor']).add(uses='config.yml')
with f:
    r = f.post('/', inputs=Document())
```


````{admonition} Important
:class: important
If you are creating a Flow from a YAML config file which is located outside the working directory, you just need to 
specify a correct relative or absolute path of the Flow's YAML config file and make all paths to Executor config files 
relative to the Flow config file. The Flow will infer its config file location and add it to `extra_search_paths`:
```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ñ∂ main.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flow
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ flow.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ executor
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_executor.py
```
`flow.yml`:
```yaml
jtype: Flow
executors:
  - name: executor
    uses: ../executor/config.yml
```

`main.py`:
```python
from jina import Flow, Document
f = Flow.load_config('../flow/flow.yml')
with f:
    r = f.post('/', inputs=Document())
```
````

## Override Executor config

You can override an executor's meta configs when creating a flow.

### Override `metas` configuration
To override the `metas` configuration of an executor, use `uses_metas`:
```python
from jina import Executor, requests, Flow
class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        print(self.metas.workspace)

flow = Flow().add(
    uses=MyExecutor,
    uses_metas={'workspace': 'different_workspace'},
)
with flow as f:
    f.post('/')
```

```text
      executor0@219291[L]:ready and listening
        gateway@219291[L]:ready and listening
           Flow@219291[I]:üéâ Flow is ready to use!
	üîó Protocol: 		GRPC
	üè† Local access:	0.0.0.0:58827
	üîí Private network:	192.168.1.101:58827
different_workspace
```


### Override `with` configuration
To override the `with` configuration of an executor, use `uses_with`. The `with` configuration refers to user-defined 
constructor kwargs.
```python
from jina import Executor, requests, Flow

class MyExecutor(Executor):
    def __init__(self, param1=1, param2=2, param3=3, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
        self.param3 = param3

    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        print('param1:', self.param1)
        print('param2:', self.param2)
        print('param3:', self.param3)

flow = Flow().add(uses=MyExecutor, uses_with={'param1': 10, 'param3': 30})
with flow as f:
    f.post('/')
```
```text
      executor0@219662[L]:ready and listening
        gateway@219662[L]:ready and listening
           Flow@219662[I]:üéâ Flow is ready to use!
	üîó Protocol: 		GRPC
	üè† Local access:	0.0.0.0:32825
	üîí Private network:	192.168.1.101:32825
	üåê Public address:	197.28.82.165:32825
param1: 10
param2: 2
param3: 30
```


### Override `requests` configuration
You can override the `requests` configuration of an executor and bind methods to endpoints that you provide. In the following codes, we replace the endpoint `/foo` binded to the `foo()` function with `/non_foo` and add a new endpoint `/bar` for binding `bar()`. Note the `all_req()` function is binded to **all** the endpoints except those explicitly binded to other functions, i.e. `/non_foo` and `/bar`.


```python
from jina import Executor, requests, Flow

class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    def all_req(self, parameters, **kwargs):
        print(f'all req {parameters.get("recipient")}')
        
    @requests(on='/foo')
    def foo(self, parameters, **kwargs):
        print(f'foo {parameters.get("recipient")}')
    
    def bar(self, parameters, **kwargs):
        print(f'bar {parameters.get("recipient")}')

flow = Flow().add(uses=MyExecutor, uses_requests={'/bar': 'bar', '/non_foo': 'foo', })
with flow as f:
    f.post('/bar', parameters={'recipient': 'bar()'})
    f.post('/non_foo', parameters={'recipient': 'foo()'})
    f.post('/foo', parameters={'recipient': 'all_req()'})
```

```text
      executor0@221058[L]:ready and listening
        gateway@221058[L]:ready and listening
           Flow@221058[I]:üéâ Flow is ready to use!
	üîó Protocol: 		GRPC
	üè† Local access:	0.0.0.0:36507
	üîí Private network:	192.168.1.101:36507
	üåê Public address:	197.28.82.165:36507
bar
foo
```

## Add remote Executor

### Add an already spawned Executor

A Flow does not have to be local-only. You can use any Executor on remote(s). 

The external Executor in the following two use-cases could have been spawned

- either by another Flow
- or by the `jina executor` CLI command

```python
f.add(host='localhost', port_in=12345, external=True)
f.add(host='123.45.67.89', port_in=12345, external=True)
```

### [Spawn remote Executors using `JinaD`](../../advanced/daemon/remote-executors)

````{admonition} Commonly used arguments for deployment in 
:class: tip 

| Name | default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | `0.0.0.0` | The host of the machine. Can be an ip address or DNS name (e.g. `0.0.0.0`, `my_encoder.jina.ai`) |
| `port_expose` | randomly initialized | Port of JinaD on the remote machine. |
| `port_in` | randomly initialized | Port for incoming traffic for the Executor. |
| `port_out` | randomly initialized | Port for outgoing traffic for the Executor. This is only used in the remote-local use-case described below. |
| `connect_to_predecessor` | `False` | Forces a Head to connect to the previous Tail. This is only used in the remote-local use-case described below. |
| `external` | `False` | Stops `Flow` from context managing an Executor. This allows spawning of an external Executor and reusing across multiple Flows. |
| `uses`, `uses_before` and `uses_after` prefix | No prefix | When prefixing one of the `uses` arguments with `docker` or `jinahub+docker`, the Executor does not run natively, but is spawned inside a container. |

### Forcing an Executor in the remote-local config

Sometimes you want to use a remote Executor in your local Flow (e.g. using an expensive encoder on a remote GPU). Then
the remote cannot talk back to the next local Executor directly. This is similar to a server that cannot talk to a
client before the client has opened a connection. The Flow inside Jina has an auto-detection mechanism for such cases.
Anyhow, in some networking setups this mechanism fails. Then you can force this by hand by setting
the `connect_to_predecessor` argument and `port_out` to the Executor in front.

```python
f.add(name='remote', host='123.45.67.89', port_out=23456).add(name='local', connect_to_predecessor=True)
```


## Summary: common patterns


| Description | Usage (`f = Flow(...)`) |
| --- | --- |
| Local native Executor in the context |  `f.add(uses=MyExecutor)` |
| Local native Executor from a YAML | `f.add(uses='mwu_encoder.yml')` | 
| Executor from Jina Hub | `f.add(uses='jinahub://MyExecutor')` |
| Dockerized Executor from Jina Hub | `f.add(uses='jinahub+docker://MyExecutor')` |
| Generalized dockerized Executor | `f.add(uses='docker://MyExecutor')` |
| Existing remote Executor | `f.add(host='123.45.67.89', port_in=12345, external=True)` |
| Spawn Remote Executor (via `jinad` on Remote) | `f.add(uses='mwu_encoder.yml', host='123.45.67.89', port_in=12345, port_expose=8080)` |
