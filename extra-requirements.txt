# REMARKS ON TAGS
# 1. Try to reuse the existing tags if possible.
#    If you intend to create a new tag, keep it alphabetical, short and general
# 2. Package name itself is a tag already, so you dont need to tag it again.
#    For example, 'flair>=0.4.1: flair' is redundant
# 3. Tag order doesn't matter; case-sensitive; duplicated tag will be ignored
# 4. Tag `all` is reserved for representing all packages
