    A client communicates the server with HTTP protocol.

    Unlike :class:`HTTPClient`, here :meth:`post` is a coroutine (i.e. declared with the async/await syntax),
    simply calling them will not schedule them to be executed.

    To actually run a coroutine, user need to put them in an event loop, e.g. via ``asyncio.run()``,
    ``asyncio.create_task()``.

    :class:`AsyncHTTPClient` can be very useful in
    the integration settings, where Jina/Flow/Client is NOT the main logic, but rather served as a part of other program.
    In this case, users often do not want to let Jina control the ``asyncio.eventloop``. On contrary, :class:`Client`
    is controlling and wrapping the event loop internally, making the Client looks synchronous from outside.
