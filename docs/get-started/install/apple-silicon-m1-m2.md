# On Apple Silicon

If you own a macOS device with an Apple Silicon M1/M2 chip, you can run Jina **natively** on it (instead of running under Rosetta) and enjoy up to 10x faster performance. This chapter summarizes how to install Jina.

## Check terminal and device

To ensure you are using the right terminal, run:

```bash
uname -m
```

It should return:

```text
arm64
```


## Install Homebrew

`brew` is a package manager for macOS. If you have already installed it, you need to confirm it is actually installed for Apple Silicon not for Rosetta. To check that, run:

```bash
which brew
```

```text
/opt/homebrew/bin/brew
```

If it's installed under `/usr/local/` instead of `/opt/homebrew/`, it means your `brew` is installed for Rosetta not for Apple Silicon. You need to [reinstall it](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/410829).

```{danger}
Reinstalling `brew` can be a destructive operation. Ensure you have backed up your data before proceeding.
```

To (re)install brew, run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

You can observe the output to check if it contains `/opt/homebrew` to ensure you are installing for Apple Silicon.

## Install Python

Python also has to be installed for Apple Silicon. It is possible it is installed for Rosetta, and you are not aware of that. To confirm, run:

```python
import platform

platform.machine()
```

This should output:

```text
'arm64'
```

If not, then you are using Python under Rosetta, and you need to install Python for Apple Silicon with `brew`:


```bash
brew install python3
```

As of August 2022, this will install Python 3.10 natively for Apple Silicon.

Ensure you note down where `python` and `pip` are installed. In this example, they are installed to `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3` and `/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/libexec/bin/pip` respectively.

## Install dependencies wheels

There are some core dependencies that Jina needs to run, whose wheels are not available on PyPI but fortunately are available as wheels. To install them, run:

```bash
brew install protobuf numpy
```

## Install Jina

Now we can install Jina via `pip`. Ensure you use the correct `pip`:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/libexec/bin/pip install jina
```

`grpcio` requires building the wheels, it will take some time.


After all the dependencies are installed, you can run Jina CLI and check the system information.

```bash
jina -vf
```
