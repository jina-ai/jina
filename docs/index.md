# Welcome to Jina!

Jina is a framework for building cross-/multi-modal (e.g. text, images, video, audio) search systems on the cloud. It allows you to build neural search applications in just minutes.

1. Make sure that you have Python 3.7+ installed on Linux/MacOS.
2. Install Jina: ``pip install jina``
3. Run hello-world demos: ``jina hello fashion``
4. That’s it! In the next few seconds the demo will open in a new page in your browser.

Now that you’re set up, let’s dive into more of how Jina works and how to build great apps.
