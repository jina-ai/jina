# {octicon}`package` 3D Mesh

A 3D mesh defines the properties of an object in three dimensions such as shape, color and texture. It is widely used in industries such as 3D printing and gaming. In addition to the traditional data types such text, audio and images, neural search can also be applied to less typical ones such as 3D meshes.

 In this chapter, we will show you how simple it is to build a 3D mesh search pipeline and walk you through the process step by step.
