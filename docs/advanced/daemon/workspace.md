## Workspace

Workspace is the entrypoint for all objects in JinaD. It primarily represents 4 pieces.

1. **Docker Image**

   All objects created by JinaD are containerized. Workspace is responsible for building the base image. You can
   customize each image with the help of a `.jinad` file and a `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Docker Network**

   Workspace is also responsible for managing a private `bridge` network for all child containers. This provides network
   isolation from other workspaces, while allowing all containers inside the same workspace to communicate.

3. **Local work directory**

   All the files used to manage a Jina object or created by a Jina object are stored here. This directory is exposed to
   all child containers. These can be:
    - config files (e.g.- Flow/Executor YAML, Python modules etc),
    - data written by your Executor
    - logs (created by `fluentd`)
    - `.jinad` file
    - `requirements.txt` file

4. **Special files**

    - `.jinad` is an optional file defining how the base image is built. Following arguments are supported.

      ```ini
      build = default                 ; NOTE: devel/default, (gpu: to be added).
      python = 3.7                    ; NOTE: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 allowed.
      jina = 2.0.rc7                  ; NOTE: to be added.
      ports = 45678                   ; NOTE: comma separated ports to be mapped.
      run = "python app.py 45678"     ; NOTE: command to start a Jina project on remote.
      ```

      You can also deploy an end-to-end Jina project on remote using the following steps.
        - Include a `.jinad` file with `run` set to your default entrypoint (e.g. - `python app.py`)
        - Upload all your files including `.jinad` during workspace creation.
        - This will deploy a custom container with your project

    - `requirements.txt` defines all python packages to be installed using `pip` in the base image.

### Create a workspace ([redoc](https://api.jina.ai/daemon/#operation/_create_workspaces_post))

Create a directory (say `awesome_project`) on local which has all your files (`yaml`, `py_modules`, `requirements.txt`
, `.jinad` etc.)

```python
from daemon.clients import JinaDClient

client = JinaDClient(host=HOST, port=PORT)
my_workspace_id = client.workspaces.create(paths=['path_to_awesome_project'])
```
