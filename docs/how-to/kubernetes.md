# How to deploy Jina on Kubernetes

Jina natively supports deploying your Flow and Executors on Kubernetes.

A `Flow` is composed of `Executors` which run Python code
defined to operate on a `DocumentArray`. These Executors live in different runtimes depending on how you want to deploy
your Flow. 

When deployed in Kubernetes, these Executors will run inside Kubernetes Pods as containers and their lifetime will be handled
by Kubernetes.

Deploying a Flow in Kubernetes is the recommended way of using Jina in production.

## Preliminaries

Set up a Kubernetes cluster and configure cluster access locally.

```{tip}
For local testing [`minikube`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) is recommended.
```

```{seealso}

Here are some managed `Kubernetes` cluster solutions you could use:

- [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine),
- [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks),
- [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service),
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/)
```

## Deploy your `Flow`

To deploy a `Flow` on `Kubernetes`, first, you have to generate kubernetes YAML configuration files from a Jina Flow.
Then, you can use the `kubectl apply` command to create or update your Flow resources within your cluster.

```{caution}
All Executors in the Flow should be used with `jinahub+docker://...` or `docker://...`.
```

To generate YAML configurations for Kubernetes from a Jina Flow, one just needs to call:

```python
flow.to_k8s_yaml('flow_k8s_configuration')
```

This will create a folder 'flow_k8s_configuration' with a set of Kubernetes YAML configurations for all the deployments composing the Flow

## Example

### Indexing and searching images using CLIP image encoder and PQLiteIndexer

This example shows how to build and deploy a Flow in Kubernetes with [`CLIPImageEncoder`](https://hub.jina.ai/executor/0hnlmu3q) as encoder and [`PQLiteIndexer`](https://hub.jina.ai/executor/pn1qofsj) as indexer.

```python
from jina import Flow

f = (
    Flow(port_expose=8080)
    .add(name='encoder', uses='jinahub+docker://CLIPImageEncoder', replicas=2)
    .add(
        name='indexer',
        uses='jinahub+docker://PQLiteIndexer',
        uses_with={'dim': 512},
        shards=2,
    )
)
```

Now, we can generate Kubernetes YAML configs from the Flow:

```python
f.to_k8s_yaml('./k8s_flow', k8s_namespace='custom-namespace')
```

You should expect the following file structure generated:

```
.
└── k8s_flow
    ├── gateway
    │   └── gateway.yml
    └── encoder
    │   ├── encoder.yml
    │   └── encoder-head.yml
    └── indexer
        ├── indexer-0.yml
        ├── indexer-1.yml
        └── indexer-head.yml
```

As you can see, the Flow contains configuration for the gateway and the rest of executors

Let's create a kubernetes namespace for our Flow:

```shell
kubectl create namespace custom-namespace
```

Now, you can deploy this Flow to you cluster in the following way:
```shell
kubectl apply -R -f ./k8s_flow
```

We can check that the pods were created:
```shell
kubectl get pods -n custom-namespace
```

```text
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
encoder-8b5575cb9-bh2x8           1/1     Running   0          60m
encoder-8b5575cb9-gx78g           1/1     Running   0          60m
encoder-head-55bbb477ff-p2bmk   1/1     Running   0          60m
gateway-7df8765bd9-xf5tf          1/1     Running   0          60m
indexer-0-8f676fc9d-4fh52         1/1     Running   0          60m
indexer-1-55b6cc9dd8-gtpf6        1/1     Running   0          60m
indexer-head-6fcc679d95-8mrm6   1/1     Running   0          60m
```

Note that the Jina gateway was deployed with name `gateway-7df8765bd9-xf5tf`.

Once we see that all the Deployments in the Flow are ready, we can start indexing documents.

```python
import portforward

from jina.clients import Client
from docarray import DocumentArray

with portforward.forward('custom-namespace', 'gateway-7df8765bd9-xf5tf', 8080, 8080):
    client = Client(host='localhost', port=8080)
    client.show_progress = True
    docs = client.post(
        '/index',
        inputs=DocumentArray.from_files('./imgs/*.png').apply(
            lambda d: d.load_uri_to_image_tensor()
        ),
        return_results=True,
    )

    print(f' Indexed documents: {len(docs)}')
```

```{admonition} Caution
:class: caution
We heavily recommend you to deploy each `Flow` into a separate namespace. In particular, it should not be deployed into namespaces, where other essential non Jina services are running. 
If `custom-namespace` has been used by another `Flow`, please set a different `k8s_namespace` name.
```

```{admonition} Caution
:class: caution
The default deployment configurations generated by the Flow contain no special configuration objects. You may want to 
adapt it to your own needs. For instance, no Persistent Volume Object is added. 
```

```{admonition} Caution
:class: caution
Using the HTTP protocol for this example means image tensors are serialized to JSON, which is not convenient or 
efficient. We can avoid this by using the GRPC protocol or by converting images to data URIs instead.
```

## Exposing your `Flow`
The previous examples use port-forwarding to index documents to the `Flow`. 
Thinking about real world applications, 
you might want to expose your service to make it reachable by the users, so that you can serve search requests

```{caution}
Exposing your `Flow` only works if the environment of your `Kubernetes cluster` supports `External Loadbalancers`.
```

Once the `Flow` is deployed, you can expose a service.
```bash
kubectl expose deployment gateway --name=gateway-exposed --type LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080 -n custom-namespace
sleep 60 # wait until the external ip is configured
```

Export the external ip which is needed for the client in the next section when sending documents to the `Flow`. 
```bash
export EXTERNAL_IP=`kubectl get service gateway-exposed -n custom-namespace -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'`
```

### Client
The client sends an image to the exposed `Flow` on `$EXTERNAL_IP` and retrieves the matches retrieved from the Flow.
Finally, it prints the uri of the closest matches.

```python
import os

from jina.clients import Client
from docarray import DocumentArray

host = os.environ['EXTERNAL_IP']
port = 80

client = Client(host=host, port=port)
client.show_progress = True
docs = DocumentArray.from_files("./imgs/*.png").apply(
    lambda d: d.load_uri_to_image_tensor()
)
resp_query = client.post("/search", inputs=docs, return_results=True)

matches = resp_query[0].docs[0].matches
print(f"Matched documents: {len(matches)}")
```

## Scaling Executors on Kubernetes

In Jina we support two ways of scaling:

- **Replicas** can be used with any Executor type and is typically used for performance and availability.
- **Shards** are used for partitioning data and should only be used with indexers since they store state.

Check {ref}`here <how-to-replica-shard>` for more information.

Jina creates a separate Deployment in Kubernetes per Shard and uses [Kubernetes native replica scaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/scale/scale-intro/) to create multiple Replicas of a Deployment.

Once the Flow is deployed on Kubernetes, you can use all the native Kubernetes tools like `kubeclt` to perform operations on the Pods and Deployments. 

You can use this to [add or remove replicas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#scaling-a-deployment), to run [rolling update](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#updating-a-deployment) operations, etc ...


## Extra Kubernetes options

This example shows how to deploy a Jina Flow in Kubernetes based on the basic deployment configuration generated by Jina
when running `.to_k8s_yaml`.

However, is important to realize that you can edit this deployment to fit your needs.

A non-exhaustive example list of configurations you may want to adapt may include:

- Add other external deployments from which an Executor can connect to.
- Edit the default rolling update configuration.
- Edit the default configuration map
