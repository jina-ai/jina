# Flow

A {class}`~jina.Flow` orchestrates {class}`~jina.Executor`s into a processing pipeline to build a multi-modal/cross-modal application.
Documents "flow" through the pipeline and are processed by Executors.

You can think of Flow as an interface to configure and launch your {ref}`microservice architecture <architecture-overview>`,
while the heavy lifting is done by the {ref}`services <executor-cookbook>` themselves.
In particular, each Flow also launches a *Gateway* service, which can expose all other services through an API that you define.

The most important methods of the `Flow` object are the following:

| Method                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This will start all its Executors and check if they are ready to be used.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Why should you use a Flow?

Once you've learned DocumentArray and Executor, you can split your multi-modal/cross-modal application into different independent modules and services.
But you need to chain them together to bring real value and build and serve an application. Flows enable you to do exactly this.

- Flows connect microservices (Executors) to build a service with proper client/server style interface over HTTP, gRPC, or WebSockets.

- Flows let you scale these Executors independently to match your requirements.

- Flows let you easily use other cloud-native orchestrators, such as Kubernetes, to manage your service.

## Minimum working example

````{tab} Pythonic style


```python
from jina import Flow, Executor, requests, Document


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests(on='/bar')
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        print(docs)


f = Flow().add(name='myexec1', uses=MyExecutor)

with f:
    f.post(on='/bar', inputs=Document(), on_done=print)
```


````

````{tab} Flow-as-a-Service style

Server:

```python
from jina import Flow, Executor, requests


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests(on='/bar')
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        print(docs)


f = Flow(port=12345).add(name='myexec1', uses=MyExecutor)

with f:
    f.block()
```

Client:

```python
from jina import Client, Document

c = Client(port=12345)
c.post(on='/bar', inputs=Document(), on_done=print)
```

````

````{tab} Load from YAML

`my.yml`:
```yaml
jtype: Flow
executors:
  - name: myexec1
    uses: FooExecutor
    py_modules: exec.py
```

`exec.py`:
```python
from jina import Executor, requests, Document, DocumentArray


class FooExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        docs.append(Document(text='foo was here'))
```

```python
from jina import Flow, Document

f = Flow.load_config('my.yml')

with f:
    f.post(on='/bar', inputs=Document(), on_done=print)
```
