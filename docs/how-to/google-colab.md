Please follow the walkthrough there and enjoy the free GPU/TPU to build your Jina applications!


```{tip}
Hosing services on Google Colab is not recommended if your server aims to be long-lived or permanent. It is often used for quick experiments, demonstrations or leveraging its free GPU/TPU. For stable, secure and free hosting of Jina apps, check out [JCloud](https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/jcloud/).
