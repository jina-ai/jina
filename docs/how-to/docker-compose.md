# How to run Jina with Docker Compose

Jina is a cloud-native neural search framework. Therefore, one of the simplest ways of either prototyping or serving in
production is to run your `Flow` with `docker-compose`.

A `Flow` is composed of `Executors` which run Python code
defined to operate on `DocumentArray`. These `Executors` will live in different runtimes depending on how you want to deploy
your Flow. 

By default, if you are serving your Flow locally they will live within processes. Nevertheless, 
because Jina is cloud native your Flow can easily manage Executors that live in containers and that are
orchestrated by your favorite tools. One of the simplest is Docker Compose which is supported out of the box. 

You can use this with one line:

```python
flow.to_docker_compose_yaml('docker-compose.yml')
```

Jina will generate a `docker-compose.yml` configuration file that you can use directly with 
`docker-compose` and corresponds to your `Flow`, avoiding the overhead of manually defining all the services needed for the `Flow`.

```{caution}
All Executors in the Flow should be used with `jinahub+docker://...` or `docker://...`.
```

```{caution}
If you are using Executor which rely on docker image built with a jina version prior to 3.1.3, please remove the 
health check from the dump yaml file as they are only compatible with 3.1.3+ otherwise your docker compose services will 
always be `unhealthy
```
## Example: Indexing and searching images using CLIP image encoder and PQLiteIndexer


### Deploy your Flow


```{admonition} Caution
:class: caution
First ensure [`Docker Compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is installed locally.
```

```{admonition} Caution
:class: caution
Before starting this example, make sure that CLIPImageEncoder and PQLiteIndexer images are already pulled to your local machine.

You can use:

`jina hub pull jinahub+docker://CLIPImageEncoder`
`jina hub pull jinahub+docker://PQLiteIndexer`
```

This example shows how to build and deploy a Flow with Docker Compose, using [`CLIPImageEncoder`](https://hub.jina.ai/executor/0hnlmu3q)
as an image encoder and [`PQLiteIndexer`](https://hub.jina.ai/executor/pn1qofsj) as an indexer to perform fast nearest
neighbor retrieval on image embeddings.

```python
from jina import Flow

f = (
    Flow(port=8080, protocol='http')
    .add(name='encoder', uses='jinahub+docker://CLIPImageEncoder', replicas=2)
    .add(
        name='indexer',
        uses='jinahub+docker://PQLiteIndexer',
        uses_with={'dim': 512},
        shards=2,
    )
)
```

Now, we can generate Docker Compose YAML configuration from the Flow:

```python
f.to_docker_compose_yaml('docker-compose.yml')
```

````{admonition} Hint
:class: hint
You can use a custom Docker image for the Gateway service. Just set the envrironment variable `JINA_GATEWAY_IMAGE` to the desired image before generating the configuration.
````

let's take a look at the generated compose file:
```yaml
version: '3.3'
...
services:
  encoder-head:   # # # # # # # # # # # 
                  #                   #   
  encoder-rep-0:  #   Encoder         #
                  #                   #
  encoder-rep-1:  # # # # # # # # # # #

  indexer-head:   # # # # # # # # # # # 
                  #                   #   
  indexer-0:      #   Indexer         #
                  #                   #
  indexer-1:      # # # # # # # # # # #

  gateway: 
    ...
    ports:
    - 8080:8080
```

```{admonition} Caution
:class: caution
The default compose file generated by the Flow contains no special configuration or settings. You may want to 
adapt it to your own needs.
```

Here you can see that 7 services will be created:

- 1 for the `gateway` which is the entrypoint of the `Flow`.
- 3 associated with the encoder: one for the Head and two for the Replicas.
- 3 associated with the indexer, one for the Head and two for the Shards.

Now, you can deploy this Flow to your cluster:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

### Use your search engine and query your Flow

Now that your Flow is up and running in your docker-compose you can to query it:

Once we see that all the services in the Flow are ready, we can start sending index and search requests.

First let's define a client:
```python
from jina.clients import Client

client = Client(host='localhost', protocol='http', port=8080)
client.show_progress = True
```

Then let's index the set of images we want to search:

```{admonition} Caution
:class: caution
Before using your Flow, ensure you have several `.jpg` images in the `./imgs` folder.
```

```python
from docarray import DocumentArray

indexing_documents = DocumentArray.from_files('./imgs/*.jpg').apply(
    lambda d: d.load_uri_to_image_tensor()
)

indexed_docs = client.post('/index', inputs=indexing_documents)

print(f'Indexed Documents: {len(indexed_docs)}')
```

Then let's search for the closest image to our query image:

```python
query_doc = indexing_documents[0]
queried_docs = client.post("/search", inputs=[query_doc])

matches = queried_docs[0].matches
print(f'Matched documents: {len(matches)}')
```
