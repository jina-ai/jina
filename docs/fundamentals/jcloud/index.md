After you built a Jina project, the next step is to deploy and host it somewhere. JCloud simplifies deploying and hosting your Jina projects on Jina Cloud. It provides a simple CLI with five commands to manage the lifecycle of your Jina projects.

Strictly speaking JCloud has two parts: the cloud part (i.e. Jina Cloud) and the client part. Specifically, using JCloud means deploying a Jina project with the client to the cloud. This chapter will guide you to use client.
