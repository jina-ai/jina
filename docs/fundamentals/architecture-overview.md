# Basic Concepts

This chapter introduces the basic terminologies you will encounter in the docs. But first, let's look at the code below:

(dummy-example)=
````{tab} Server
```python
from jina import DocumentArray, Executor, Flow, requests


class FooExec(Executor):
    @requests
    async def add_text(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        for d in docs:
            d.text += 'hello, world!'


class BarExec(Executor):
    @requests
    async def add_text(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        for d in docs:
            d.text += 'goodbye!'


f = Flow(port=12345).add(uses=FooExec, replicas=3).add(uses=BarExec, replicas=2)

with f:
    f.block()
```
````

````{tab} Client
```python
from jina import Client, DocumentArray

c = Client(port=12345)
r = c.post('/', DocumentArray.empty(2))
print(r.texts)
```
````

Running it gives you:

```text
['hello, world!goodbye!', 'hello, world!goodbye!']
```

The following concepts will be covered in the user guide:

```{glossary}

**Document**
    Document is the fundamental data structure in Jina for representing multi-modal and cross-modal data. It is the essential element of IO in Jina. More information can be found in [DocArray's Docs](https://docarray.jina.ai/fundamentals/document/). 

**DocumentArray**
    DocumentArray is a list-like container of multiple Documents. More information can be found in [DocArray's Docs](https://docarray.jina.ai/fundamentals/documentarray/). 
    
**Executor**
    {class}`~jina.Executor` is a Python class that has a group of functions using {term}`DocumentArray` as IO. Loosely speaking, each Executor is a microservice. 

**Flow**
    {class}`~jina.Flow` ties multiple {class}`~jina.Executor`s together into a logic pipeline to achieve a task. If Executor is a microservice, then Flow is the end-to-end service. 

**Gateway**
    Gateway is the entrypoint of a {term}`Flow`. It exposes multiple protocols for external communications; it routes all internal traffics.
    
**Client**
    {class}`~jina.Client` is for connecting to a {term}`Gateway` and sending/receiving data from it.

**Deployment**
    Deployment is an abstraction around {class}`~jina.Executor` that lets the {term}`Gateway` communicate with an Executor. It encapsulates and abstracts internal replication details.

**gRPC, Websocket, HTTP**
    They are network protocols for transmitting data. gRPC is always used between {term}`Gateway` and {term}`Deployment` communication.

**TLS**
    TLS is a security protocol designed to facilitate privacy and data security for communications over the Internet. The communication between {term}`Client` and {term}`Gateway` is protected by TLS.
```

## Two coding styles

In the documentation, you often see two coding styles when describing a Jina project: 

```{glossary}

**Pythonic**
    The Flow and Executors are all written in Python files, and the entrypoint is via Python.
    
**YAMLish** 
    The Executors are written in Python files, and the Flow is defined in a YAML file. The entrypoint is via Jina CLI `jina flow --uses flow.yml`.
```

For example, {ref}`the serve-side code<dummy-example>` above follows {term}`Pythonic` style. It can be written as {term}`YAMLish` style as follows:

````{tab} executor.py
```python
from jina import DocumentArray, Executor, requests


class FooExec(Executor):
    @requests
    async def add_text(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        for d in docs:
            d.text += 'hello, world!'


class BarExec(Executor):
    @requests
    async def add_text(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        for d in docs:
            d.text += 'goodbye!'
```
````

````{tab} flow.yml
```yaml
jtype: Flow
with:
  port: 12345
executors:
- uses: FooExec
  replicas: 3
  py_modules: executor.py
- uses: BarExec
  replicas: 2
  py_modules: executor.py
```
````

````{tab} Entrypoint
```bash
jina flow --uses flow.yml
```
````

The YAMLish style separates the Flow representation from the logic code. It is more flexible to config and should be used for more complex projects in production. In many integrations such as JCloud, Kubernetes, YAMLish is more preferred. 

Note that the two coding styles can be converted to each other easily. To load a Flow YAML into Python and run it:

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow.load_config('flow.yml')

with f:
    f.block()
```

To dump a Flow into YAML:

```python
from jina import Flow

Flow().add(uses=FooExec, replicas=3).add(uses=BarExec, replicas=2).save_config(
    'flow.yml'
)
```


## Relationship between Jina and DocArray

[DocArray](https://docarray.jina.ai/) is a crucial upstream dependency of Jina. It is the data structure behind Jina. Without DocArray, Jina can not run.

DocArray contains a set of rich API for on the local & monolith development. Jina scales DocArray to the cloud. The picture below shows their relationship.

```{figure} docarray-jina.svg
```

In a common development journey, a brand-new project first moves horizontally left with DocArray, leveraging all machine learning stacks to improve quality and completing logics in a local environment. At this point, a POC is built. Then move vertically up with Jina, enhancing the POC with service endpoint, scalability and cloud-native features. Finally, you reach to the point where your service is ready for production.
