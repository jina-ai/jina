# Release Cycle

We follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), numbered with `x.y.z`.

## Version Explained

| `latest` | the last Friday release, contains the bare minimum of to run Jina framework. |
| `x.y.z` | (previous) Friday release. |
| `devel` | the development version corresponds to the latest master, it extends `latest` by adding required packages for [Dashboard](https://github.com/jina-ai/dashboard). |
| `x.y.z-devel` | (previous) `devel` version of `x.y.z` |

### Which Version to Use?

- Use `latest`, if you want to use barebone Jina framework and extend it with your own modules/plugins.
- Use `devel`, if you want to use [Dashboard](https://github.com/jina-ai/dashboard) to get more insights about the logs and flows.

## Master Update

Every successful merge into the master triggers a development release. It will: 

- update the Docker image with tag `devel`;
- update [jina-ai/docs](https://github.com/jina-ai/docs) tag `devel`

Note, commits started with `chore` are exceptions and will not trigger the events above. Right now these commits are:

- `chore(docs): update TOC`
- `chore(version): bumping master version`

## Friday Release

On Friday release, it will:

- tag the master as `vx.y.z` and push to the repo;
- create a new tag `vx.y.z` in [jina-ai/docs](https://github.com/jina-ai/docs);
- publish `x.y.z` docker image, with tag `latest`, `x.y.z`;
- upload `x.y.z` package on PyPI;
- bump the master to `x.y.(z+1)` and commit a `chore(version)` push.

The current master version should always be one version ahead of `git tag -l | sort -V | tail -n1`.
