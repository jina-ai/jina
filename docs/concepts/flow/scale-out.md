# Scale Out

{class}`~jina.Flow` orchestrates multiple {class}`~jina.Executor`s.
By default, all Executors run with a single instance. If one Executor in the Flow is particularly slow, then it will reduce the overall throughput of the entire Flow.

To solve this, you can specify the number of `replicas` to scale out an Executor.

## Replicate Executors

Replication creates multiple copies of the same {class}`~jina.Executor`. Each request in the {class}`~jina.Flow` is then passed to only one replica (instance) of that Executor. **All replicas compete for a request. The idle replica gets the request first.**

This is useful for improving performance and availability:
* If you have slow Executors (e.g. embedding) you can scale up the number of instances to process multiple requests in parallel.
* Executors might need to be taken offline occasionally (for updates, failures, etc.), but you may want your Flow to be still able to process requests without any downtime. Adding replicas allows any replica to be taken down as long as there is at least one in the Flow. This ensures the high availability of your Flow.

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add(name='slow_encoder', replicas=3).add(name='fast_indexer')
```

```{figure} replicas-flow.svg
:width: 70%
:align: center
Flow with three replicas of slow_encoder and one replica of fast_indexer
```

The above Flow creates a topology with three replicas of the Executor `slow_encoder`. The `Flow` sends every 
request to exactly one of the three instances. Then the replica sends its result to `fast_indexer`.

## Replicate on multiple GPUs

To replicate your {class}`~jina.Executor`s so that each replica uses a different GPU on your machine, you can tell the {class}`~jina.Flow` to use multiple GPUs by passing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=RR` as an environment variable.
The Flow then assigns each available GPU to replicas in a round-robin fashion.

```{caution} 
You should only replicate on multiple GPUs with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=RR` locally.  
```

```{tip}
In Kubernetes or with Docker Compose you should allocate GPU resources to each replica directly in the configuration files.
```

For example, if you have three GPUs and one of your Executor has five replicas then:

````{tab} Python
 In a `flow.py` file 
```python
from jina import Flow

with Flow().add(
    uses='jinaai://jina-ai/CLIPEncoder', replicas=5, install_requirements=True
) as f:
    f.block()
```

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=RR python flow.py
```
````

````{tab} YAML
In a `flow.yaml` file
```yaml
jtype: Flow
executors:
- uses: jinaai://jina-ai/CLIPEncoder
  install_requirements: True
  replicas: 5  
```

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=RR jina flow --uses flow.yaml
```
````

The Flow assigns GPU devices in the following round-robin fashion:

| GPU device | Replica ID |
|------------|------------|
| 0          | 0          |
| 1          | 1          |
| 2          | 2          |
| 0          | 3          |
| 1          | 4          |

 
You can restrict the visible devices in round-robin assignment using `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=RR0:2`, where `0:2` corresponds to a Python slice. This creates the following assignment:

| GPU device | Replica ID |
|------------|------------|
| 0          | 0          |
| 1          | 1          |
| 0          | 2          |
| 1          | 3          |
| 0          | 4          |


You can restrict the visible devices in round-robin assignment by assigning the list of device IDs to `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=RR1,3`. This creates the following assignment:

| GPU device | Replica ID |
|------------|------------|
| 1          | 0          |
| 3          | 1          |
| 1          | 2          |
| 3          | 3          |
| 1          | 4          |

You can also refer to GPUs by their UUID. For instance, you could assign a list of device UUIDs 

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=RRGPU-0aaaaaaa-74d2-7297-d557-12771b6a79d5,GPU-0bbbbbbb-74d2-7297-d557-12771b6a79d5,GPU-0ccccccc-74d2-7297-d557-12771b6a79d5,GPU-0ddddddd-74d2-7297-d557-12771b6a79d5
```

Check [CUDA Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#env-vars) to see the accepted formats to assign CUDA devices by UUID.

| GPU device | Replica ID |
|------------|------------|
| GPU-0aaaaaaa-74d2-7297-d557-12771b6a79d5          | 0          |
| GPU-0bbbbbbb-74d2-7297-d557-12771b6a79d5          | 1          |
| GPU-0ccccccc-74d2-7297-d557-12771b6a79d5          | 2          |
| GPU-0ddddddd-74d2-7297-d557-12771b6a79d5          | 3          |
| GPU-0aaaaaaa-74d2-7297-d557-12771b6a79d5          | 4          |

## Replicate external Executors

If you have external Executors with multiple replicas running elsewhere, you can add them to your Flow by specifying all the respective hosts and ports:

```python
from jina import Flow

replica_hosts, replica_ports = ['localhost','91.198.174.192'], ['12345','12346']
Flow().add(host=replica_hosts, port=replica_ports, external=True)

# alternative syntax
Flow().add(host=['localhost:12345','91.198.174.192:12346'], external=True)
```

This connects to `grpc://localhost:12345` and `grpc://91.198.174.192:12346` as two replicas of the external Executor.

````{admonition} Reducing
:class: hint
If an external Executor needs multiple predecessors, reducing needs to be enabled. So setting no_reduce=True is not allowed for these cases. 
````

## Customize polling behaviors

Replicas compete for a request, so only one of them will get the request. What if we want all replicas to get the request? 

For example, considering the index and search requests:

- Index (and update, delete) are handled by a single replica, as this is sufficient to add it one time.
- Search requests are handled by all replicas, as you need to search over all replicas to ensure the completeness of the result. The requested data could be on any shard.

For this purpose, you need `shards` and `polling`.

You can define if all or any `shards` receive the request by specifying `polling`. `ANY` means only one shard receives the request, while  `ALL` means that all shards receive the same request.

```python Usage
from jina import Flow

flow = Flow().add(name='ExecutorWithShards', shards=3, polling={'/custom': 'ALL', '/search': 'ANY', '*': 'ANY'})
```

The above example results in a {class}`~jina.Flow` having the Executor `ExecutorWithShards` with the following polling options:
- `/index` has polling `ANY` (the default value is not changed here).
- `/search` has polling `ANY` as it is explicitly set (usually that should not be necessary).
- `/custom` has polling `ALL`.
- All other endpoints have polling `ANY` due to using `*` as a wildcard to catch all other cases.

### Understand behaviors of replicas and shards with polling

The following example demonstrates the different behaviors when setting `replicas`, `shards` and `polling` together.

```{code-block} python
---
emphasize-lines: 13
---
from jina import Flow, Document, Executor, requests


class MyExec(Executor):

    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        print(f'inside: {docs.texts}')


f = (
    Flow()
    .add(uses=MyExec, replicas=2, polling='ANY')
    .needs_all()
)

with f:
    r = f.post('/', Document(text='hello'))
    print(f'return: {r.texts}')
```

We now change the combination of the yellow highlight line above and see if there is any difference in the console output (note two print in the snippet):

|              	| `polling='ALL'`                                        	| `polling='ANY'`                     	|
|--------------	|--------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------	|
| `replicas=2` 	| inside: ['hello'] return: ['hello']                    	| inside: ['hello'] return: ['hello'] 	|
| `shards=2`   	| inside: ['hello'] inside: ['hello']  return: ['hello'] 	| inside: ['hello'] return: ['hello'] 	|
