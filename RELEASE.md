We follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), numbered with `x.y.z`.

## Docker Image Tag Explained

| Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `latest` | the last Sunday release, contains the bare minimum of to run Jina framework. |
| `x.y.z` | (previous) Sunday release. |
| `devel` | the development version corresponds to the latest master, it extends `latest` by adding required packages for [Dashboard](https://github.com/jina-ai/dashboard). |
| `x.y.z-devel` | (previous) `devel` version of `x.y.z` |
| `x.y` | shortcut alias to the last `x.y.z` release |

### Which Version to Use?

- Use `latest`, if you want to use barebone Jina framework and extend it with your own modules/plugins.
- Use `devel`, if you want to use [Dashboard](https://github.com/jina-ai/dashboard) to get more insights about the logs and flows.

## Master Update

Every successful merge into the master triggers a development release. It will: 

- update the Docker image with tag `devel`;
- update [jina-ai/docs](https://github.com/jina-ai/docs) tag `devel`

Note, commits started with `chore` are exceptions and will not trigger the events above. Right now these commits are:

- `chore(docs): update TOC`
- `chore(version): bumping master version`

## Sunday Auto Release

On every Sunday 23pm, a patch release is scheduled:

- tag the master as `vx.y.z` and push to the repo;
- create a new tag `vx.y.z` in [jina-ai/docs](https://github.com/jina-ai/docs);
- publish `x.y.z` docker image, with tag `latest`, `x.y.z`;
- upload `x.y.z` package on PyPI;
- bump the master to `x.y.(z+1)` and commit a `chore(version)` push.

The current master version should always be one version ahead of `git tag -l | sort -V | tail -n1`.

## Nightly Release

Every midnight at 0:00, the docker image tagged with `x.y.z-devel` will be rebuilt on all platforms, include: linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/ppc64le, linux/386, linux/arm/v7, linux/arm/v6.
