After building a Jina project, the next step is to deploy and host it on Cloud. JCloud simplifies deploying and hosting your Jina projects on Jina Cloud. It provides a simple CLI with five commands to manage the lifecycle of your Jina projects.

```{tip}
At this point, Jina Cloud hosts all your Jina projects and offers computational/storage resources **for free**!
```

## Basic

Jina Cloud provides a CLI and you can use it simply via `jina cloud` from the terminal, or `jcloud` or simply `jc` for minimalists. 


````{hint}
You can also only install Jina Cloud CLI without install `jina` package.

```bash
pip install jcloud
jc -h
```

If you installed it individually, all of its commands come under the `jc` or `jcloud` executable.


In case `jc` is already occupied by another tool, please use `jcloud` instead. If your pip install doesn't register bash commands for you, you can run `python -m jcloud -h`.
````

For the rest of this section, we will be using `jc` or `jcloud`. But again they are interchangable to `jina cloud`.


### Login

```bash
jc login
```

You can use a Google/GitHub account to register and login. For all the next steps, logging in is mandatory.

If you have no access to the web browser in your integration environment, you can set the Environment Variable `JINA_AUTH_TOKEN` using auth token before working with JCloud. Auth token can be generated by user login or Personal Access Token (PAT) creation, please visit [jina-auth](https://github.com/jina-ai/auth) for more information (`jc` includes `jina-auth` already).

### Deploy

In Jina's idiom, a project is a [Flow](https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/flow/), which represents an end-to-end task such as indexing, searching or recommending. In this README, we will use "project" and "Flow" interchangeably.

A Flow can have two types of file structure: a single YAML file or a project folder.

#### A single YAML file

A self-contained YAML file, consisting of all configs at the [Flow](https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/flow/)-level and [Executor](https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/executor/)-level.

> All Executors' `uses` must follow the format `jinahub+docker://MyExecutor` (from [Jina Hub](https://hub.jina.ai)) to avoid any local file dependencies.

e.g.-

```yaml
# flow.yml
jtype: Flow
executors:
  - name: sentencizer
    uses: jinahub+docker://Sentencizer
```

To deploy,

```bash
jc deploy flow.yml
```

````{tip}
Testing locally before deploying is recommended. You can use 

```bash
jina flow --uses flow.yml
```
````


#### A project folder

Just like a regular Python project, you can have sub-folders of Executor implementations; and a `flow.yml` on the top-level to connect all Executors together.

You can create an example local project using `jc new hello`. The default structure looks like:

```
hello/
├── .env
├── executor1
│   ├── config.yml
│   ├── executor.py
│   └── requirements.txt
└── flow.yml
```

where,

- `hello/` is your top-level project folder.
- `executor1` directory has all Executor related code/config. You can read the best practices for [file structures](https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/executor/executor-files/). Multiple such Executor directories can be created.
- `flow.yml` Your Flow YAML.
- `.env` All environment variables used during deployment.

To deploy,

```bash
jc deploy hello
```


The Flow is successfully deployed when you see:

```{figure} deploy.png
:width: 70%
```

You will get a Flow ID, say `173503c192`. This ID is required to manage, view logs and remove the Flow.

As this Flow is deployed with default gRPC gateway (feel free to change it to `http` or `websocket`), you can use `jina.Client` to access it:

```python
from jina import Client, Document

c = Client(host='https://173503c192.wolf.jina.ai')
print(c.post('/', Document(text='hello')))
```



### View logs

To watch the logs in realtime:

```bash
jc logs 173503c192
```

You can also stream logs for a particular Executor by passing its name:

```bash
jc logs 173503c192 --executor sentencizer
```

### Remove Flows

You can either remove a single Flow, multiple selected Flows or even all Flows by passing different kind of identifiers.

To remove a single Flow:

```bash
jc remove 173503c192
```

To remove multiple selected Flows:

```bash
jc remove 173503c192 887f6313e5 ddb8a2c4ef
```

To remove all Flows:

```bash
jc remove all
```

By default, removing multiple selected / all Flows would be in interactive mode where confirmation will be sent prior to
the deletion, to make it non-interactive to better suit your use case, set below environment variable before running the command:

```bash
export JCLOUD_NO_INTERACTIVE=1
```

### Get status

To get the status of a Flow:
```bash
jc status 15937a10bd
```

```{figure} status.png
:width: 70%
```

### Monitoring
Basic monitoring is provided to the Flows deployed on JCloud.

To access the [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) powered dashboard, get `{ref} the status of the Flow <jcloud-flow-status>` first, at the bottom of the pane you should see the `dashboards` link. Visit the URL and you will find some basic metrics such as 'Number of Request Gateway Received' and 'Time elapsed between receiving a request and sending back the response':

```{figure} monitoring.png
:width: 70%
```

### List Flows

To list all the Flows you have:
```bash
jc list
```

You can see the ALIVE Flows deployed by you.

```{figure} list.png
:width: 70%
```


You can also filter your Flows by passing a status:

```bash
jc list --status FAILED
```


```{figure} list_failed.png
:width: 70%
```

Or see all the flows:

```bash
jc list --status ALL
```

```{figure} list_all.png
:width: 70%
```



### Pass environment variables

#### A single YAML

```bash
jc deploy flow.yml --env-file flow.env
```

#### A project folder

- You can include your environment variables in the `.env` file in the local project and JCloud will take care of managing them.
- You can optionally pass a `custom.env`.
  ```bash
  jc deploy ./hello --env-file ./hello/custom.env
  ```
  
## Troubleshooting

If your deployment failed, please enable verbose logging and redeploy it. You can add `--loglevel DEBUG` _before_ each CLI subcommand, e.g.

```bash
jc --loglevel DEBUG deploy flow.yml
```

Alternatively, you can configure it by using environment variable `JCLOUD_LOGLEVEL`, e.g.

```bash
JCLOUD_LOGLEVEL=DEBUG jc deploy flow.yml
```

If you don't see any obvious errors, please raise an issue in [JCloud](https://github.com/jina-ai/jcloud/issues/new/choose)

## FAQ

- **Is everything free?**

  Yes at the moment! We just need your feedback - use `jc survey` to help us understand your needs.

- **How powerful is JCloud?**

  JCloud scales according to your need. You can demand all the resources (GPU / RAM / CPU / Storage / instance-capacity) your Flows & Executors need. If there's anything particular you'd be looking for, you can contact us [on Slack](https://slack.jina.ai) or let us know via `jc survey`.

- **What restrictions are there on JCloud?**

  - Deployments are only supported in `us-east` region.
  - Each Executor is allowed a maximum of 4 GPUs, 16G RAM, 16 CPU cores & 10GB of block storage.
