Jina is *the* cloud-native semantic search solution powered by SOTA AI technology.


## Getting Started

The simplest way to run Jina is via the docker container.  

### Run with docker image

```bash
docker run jinaai/jina:master-debian
```

This command downloads the latest Jina image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jinaai/) and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an help message and exits.

#### Github Package (Do not support multiarch)

```bash
docker login -u USERNAME -p TOKEN docker.pkg.github.com
docker run docker.pkg.github.com/jina-ai/jina/jina:[tag]
```

#### Tencent Cloud (Too slow to upload)

```bash
docker login -u USERNAME -p TOKEN ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com
docker run ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/jina/jina:[tag]
```

If you want to run Jina without Docker, please make sure you have Python 3.7 installed. 
If you are using `pyenv` for controlling the Python virtual environment, make sure the Jina codebase is covered by `pyenv local 3.7.x`
