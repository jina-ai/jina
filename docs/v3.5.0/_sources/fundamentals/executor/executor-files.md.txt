# File structure

Besides organizing your Executor code inline, you can also write it as an "external" module and then use it via YAML. This is useful when your Executor’s logic is too complicated to fit into a single file.

```{tip}
The best practice is to use `jina hub new` to create a new Executor. It automatically generates the files you need in the correct structure.
```

## Single Python file + YAML

When you are only working with a single python file (let's call it `my_executor.py`), you can simply put it at the root of the repository, and import it directly in `config.yml`

```yaml
jtype: MyExecutor
metas:
  py_modules:
    - my_executor.py
```

## Multiple Python files + YAML



When you are working with multiple python files, you should organize them as a **Python package** and put them in a special folder inside
your repository (as you would normally do with Python packages). Specifically, you should do the following:

- put all your Python files inside a special folder (call it `executor`, as a convention), and put an `__init__.py` file inside it
  - because of how Jina registers executors, make sure to import your executor in this file (see the contents of `executor/__init__.py` in the example below).
- use relative imports (`from .bar import foo`, and not `from bar import foo`) inside the python modules in this folder
- Only list `executor/__init__.py` under `py_modules` in `config.yml` - this way Python knows that you are importing a package, and makes sure that all the relative imports within your package work properly

To make things more specific, take this repository structure as an example:

```
.
├── config.yml
└── executor
    ├── helper.py
    ├── __init__.py
    └── my_executor.py
```

The contents of `executor/__init__.py` is

```python
from .my_executor import MyExecutor
```

the contents of `executor/helper.py` is

```python
def print_something():
    print('something')
```

and the contents of `executor/my_executor.py` is

```python
from jina import Executor, requests

from .helper import print_something


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, **kwargs):
        print_something()
```

Finally, the contents of `config.yml` - notice that only the `executor/__init__.py` file needs to be listed under `py_modules`

```yaml
jtype: MyExecutor
metas:
  py_modules:
    - executor/__init__.py
```

This was a relatively simple example, but this way of structuring python modules works for any python package structure, however complex. Consider this slightly more complicated example

```
.
├── config.yml           # Remains exactly the same as before
└── executor
    ├── helper.py
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── my_executor.py
    └── utils/
        ├── __init__.py  # Required inside all executor sub-folders
        ├── data.py
        └── io.py
```

Here you can then import from `utils/data.py` in `my_executor.py` like this: `from .utils.data import foo`, and do any other kinds of relative imports that python enables.

The best thing is that no matter how complicated your package structure, "importing" it in your `config.yml` file is super easy - you always put only `executor/__init__.py` under `py_modules`.
