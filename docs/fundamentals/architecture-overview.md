# Glossary

This chapter introduces the terminologies you will encounter in the docs. But first, let's look at the code below:

````{tab} Server
```python
from jina import DocumentArray, Executor, Flow, requests


class FooExec(Executor):
    @requests
    async def add_text(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        for d in docs:
            d.text += 'hello, world!'


class BarExec(Executor):
    @requests
    async def add_text(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        for d in docs:
            d.text += 'goodbye!'


f = Flow(port=12345).add(uses=FooExec, replicas=3).add(uses=BarExec, replicas=2)

with f:
    f.block()
```
````

````{tab} Client
```python
from jina import Client, DocumentArray

c = Client(port=12345)
r = c.post('/', DocumentArray.empty(2))
print(r.texts)
```
````

Running it gives you:

```text
['hello, world!goodbye!', 'hello, world!goodbye!']
```

The following concepts will be covered in the user guide:

```{glossary}

Document
    Document is the fundamental data structure in Jina for representing multi-modal and cross-modal data. It is the essential element of IO in Jina. More information can be found in [DocArray's Docs](https://docarray.jina.ai/fundamentals/document/). 

DocumentArray
    DocumentArray is a list-like container of multiple Documents. More information can be found in [DocArray's Docs](https://docarray.jina.ai/fundamentals/documentarray/). 
    
Executor 
    Execurtor is a Python class that has a group of functions using {term}`DocumentArray` as IO. Loosely speaking, each Executor is a microservice. 

Flow
    Flow ties multiple Executors together into a logic pipeline to achieve a task. If Executor is a microservice, then Flow is the end-to-end service. 

Gateway
    Gateway is the entrypoint of a {term}`Flow`. It exposes multiple protocols for external communications; it routes all internal traffics.
    
Client
    Client is for connecting to a {term}`Gateway` and sending/receiving data from it.

Deployment
    Deployment is an abstraction around Executor that lets the {term}`Gateway` communicate with an Executor. It encapsulates and abstracts internal replication details.

gRPC, Websocket, HTTP
    They are network protocols for transmitting data. gRPC is always used between {term}`Gateway` and {term}`Deployment` communication.

TLS
    TLS is a security protocol designed to facilitate privacy and data security for communications over the Internet. The communication between {term}`Client` and {term}`Gateway` i protected by TLS.
