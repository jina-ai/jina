# Executor Hub

Now that you understand that {class}`~jina.Executor` is a building block in Jina, you may also wonder:

- Can I reuse my Executor in another project?
- Can I share my Executor with my colleagues?
- Can I just use someone else's Executor instead of building it myself?

Basically, something like the following:

```{figure} ../../../../.github/hub-user-journey.svg
:align: center
```

**Yes!** This is exactly the purpose of Executor Hub - a marketplace for Executors. With Hub you can pull prebuilt
Executors to dramatically reduce the effort and complexity needed in your search system, or push your own custom
Executors to share privately or publicly.

A Hub Executor is an Executor published on Executor Hub. You can use such an Executor in a Flow:

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add(uses='jinaai+docker://<username>/MyExecutor')

with f:
    ...
``` 

## Hub architecture

The Hub architecture looks like the following:

```{figure} ../../../../.github/hub-system.svg
:align: center
```

```{toctree}
:hidden:

hub-portal
create-hub-executor
push-executor
use-hub-executor
sandbox
debug-executor

```
