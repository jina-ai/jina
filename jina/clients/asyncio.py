class AsyncClient(BaseClient):
    """
    :class:`AsyncClient` is the asynchronous version of the :class:`Client`. They share the same interface, except
    in :class:`AsyncClient` :meth:`train`, :meth:`index`, :meth:`search` methods are coroutines
    (i.e. declared with the async/await syntax), simply calling them will not schedule them to be executed.
    To actually run a coroutine, user need to put them in an eventloop, e.g. via ``asyncio.run()``,
    ``asyncio.create_task()``.

    :class:`AsyncClient` can be very useful in
    the integration settings, where Jina/Flow/Client is NOT the main logic, but rather served as a part of other program.
    In this case, users often do not want to let Jina control the ``asyncio.eventloop``. On contrary, :class:`Client`
    is controlling and wrapping the eventloop internally, making the Client looks synchronous from outside.

    For example, say you have the Flow running in remote. You want to use Client to connect to it do
    some index and search, but meanwhile you have some other IO-bounded jobs and want to do them concurrently.
    You can use :class:`AsyncClient`,
