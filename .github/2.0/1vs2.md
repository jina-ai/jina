# 3 Reasons to Use Jina 2.0

Easier, Faster, Powerful

## 2.0 is as easy as 1, 2, 3

Learning Jina 1.x was hard, in 2.0 it is as simple as 1, 2, 3.

With only three concepts - **`Document`**, **`Executor`** and **`Flow`**, with their redesigned Pythonic interface, you'll get
up to speed in no time.

## 2.0 is faster and lighter

Compared to 1.x (`1.4.2`), 2.0 is

- 220% faster on startup;
- 220% faster on `import`;
- 5% faster on data transmission.

from tests import random_docs

f = Flow().add().add().add().add()

with f:
    f.index(random_docs(10000))
```

## 2.0 gives *You* the power

Jina 1.x was a complex beast with lots of boilerplate code and not so much transparency. 2.0 embraces explicit
above implicit: **No more `Driver`!** We're putting the power back in your hands. You can process `Document` in
custom `Executor` directly with all the power that entails:

```python
from jina import Document, DocumentArray, Executor, Flow, requests


class MyExecutor(Executor):

    @requests
    def add_world(self, docs: DocumentArray):
        for doc in docs:
            doc.text += 'world'


with Flow().add(uses=MyExecutor) as f:
    f.post('/', Document())
```

If you a power user of Python, then you are a power user of Jina 2.0.
