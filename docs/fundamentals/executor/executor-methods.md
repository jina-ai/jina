# `@requests` methods

Methods of `Executor` can be named and written freely. 

Methods decorated with `@requests` are mapped to network endpoints while serving.

(executor-requests)=
## Decorator

Executor methods decorated with `@requests` are bound to specific network requests, and respond to network queries.

Both `def` or `async def` function can be decorated with `@requests`.

You can import the `requests` decorator via

```python
from jina import requests
```

`requests` is a decorator that takes an optional parameter: `on=`. It binds the decorated method of the `Executor` to the specified route. 

```python
from jina import Executor, requests
import asyncio


class RequestExecutor(Executor):
    @requests(
        on=['/index', '/search']
    )  # foo will be bound to `/index` and `/search` endpoints
    def foo(self, **kwargs):
        print(f'Calling foo')

    @requests(on='/other')  # bar will be bound to `/other` endpoint
    async def bar(self, **kwargs):
        await asyncio.sleep(1.0)
        print(f'Calling bar')
```

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add(uses=RequestExecutor)

with f:
    f.post(on='/index', inputs=[])
    f.post(on='/other', inputs=[])
    f.post(on='/search', inputs=[])
```

```console
           Flow@18048[I]:üéâ Flow is ready to use!

```

### Default binding

A class method decorated with plain `@requests` (without `on=`) is the default handler for all endpoints.
That means it is the fallback handler for endpoints that are not found. `f.post(on='/blah', ...)` will invoke `MyExecutor.foo`.

```python
from jina import Executor, requests
import asyncio


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, **kwargs):
        print(kwargs)

    @requests(on='/index')
    async def bar(self, **kwargs):
        await asyncio.sleep(1.0)
        print(f'Calling bar')
```


### No binding

A class with no `@requests` binding plays no part in the Flow. 
The request will simply pass through without any processing.

## Arguments

All Executor methods decorated by `@requests` need to follow the signature below in order to be usable as a microservice inside a `Flow`.
The `async` definition is optional.

```python
from typing import Dict, Union, List
from jina import Executor, requests, DocumentArray


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    async def foo(
        self, docs: DocumentArray, parameters: Dict, docs_matrix: List[DocumentArray]
    ) -> Union[DocumentArray, Dict, None]:
        pass

    @requests
    def bar(
        self, docs: DocumentArray, parameters: Dict, docs_matrix: List[DocumentArray]
    ) -> Union[DocumentArray, Dict, None]:
        pass
```

Let's take a look at all these arguments:

- `docs`: A `DocumentArray` that is part of the request. Since the nature of `Executor` is to wrap functionality related to `DocumentArray`, it is usually the main processing unit inside `Executor` methods. It is important to notice that these `docs` can be also changed in place, just like it could happen with 
any other `list`-like object in a Python function.

- `parameters`: A Dict object that can be used to pass extra parameters to the `Executor` functions.

- `docs_matrix`:  This is the least common parameter to be used for an `Executor`. This argument is needed when an `Executor` is used inside a `Flow` to merge or reduce the output of more than one other `Executor`.

 



````{admonition} Hint
:class: hint
If you don't need some arguments, you can suppress them into `**kwargs`. For example:

```{code-block} python
---
emphasize-lines: 7, 11, 16
---
from jina import Executor, requests


class MyExecutor(Executor):

    @requests
    def foo_using_docs_arg(self, docs, **kwargs):
        print(docs)

    @requests
    def foo_using_docs_parameters_arg(self, docs, parameters, **kwargs):
        print(docs)
        print(parameters)

    @requests
    def foo_using_no_arg(self, **kwargs):
        # the args are suppressed into kwargs
        print(kwargs['docs_matrix'])
```
````


### Multiple DocumentArrays as input argument

You have seen that `Executor` methods can receive three types of parameters: `docs`, `parameters` and `docs_matrix`.

`docs_matrix` is a parameter that is only used in some special cases.

One case is when an Executor receives messages from more than one upstream Executor in the Flow.

Let's see an example:

```python
from jina import Flow, Executor, requests, Document, DocumentArray


class Exec1(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        for doc in docs:
            doc.text = 'Exec1'


class Exec2(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        for doc in docs:
            doc.text = 'Exec2'


class MergeExec(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, docs_matrix, **kwargs):
        documents_to_return = DocumentArray()
        for doc1, doc2 in zip(*docs_matrix):
            print(
                f'MergeExec processing pairs of Documents "{doc1.text}" and "{doc2.text}"'
            )
            documents_to_return.append(
                Document(text=f'Document merging from "{doc1.text}" and "{doc2.text}"')
            )
        return documents_to_return


f = (
    Flow()
    .add(uses=Exec1, name='exec1')
    .add(uses=Exec2, name='exec2')
    .add(uses=MergeExec, needs=['exec1', 'exec2'], disable_reduce=True)
)

with f:
    returned_docs = f.post(on='/', Document())

print(f'Resulting documents {returned_docs[0].text}')
```

## Returns

Every Executor method can `return` in 3 ways: 

- If you return a `DocumentArray` object, then it will be sent over to the next Executor.
- If you return `None` or if you don't have a `return` in your method, then the original `doc` object (potentially mutated by your function) will be sent over to the next Executor.
- If you return a `dict` object, then it will be considered as a result and passed on behind `parameters['__results__']`. The original `doc` object (potentially mutated by your function) will be sent over to the next Executor.


```python
from jina import requests, Executor, Flow


class MyExec(Executor):
    @requests(on='/status')
    def status(self, **kwargs):
        return {'internal_parameter': 20}


f = Flow().add(uses=MyExec, name='my_executor')

with f:
    print(f.post(on='/status').to_dict()["parameters"])
```

```json
{"__results__": {"my_executor/rep-0": {"internal_parameter": 20.0}}}
```
  
## Exception handling

Exceptions raised inside `@requests`-decorated functions can simply be raised. The Flow will handle it.

```python
from jina import Executor, requests


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, **kwargs):
        raise NotImplementedError('no time for it')
```

````{dropdown} Example usage and output

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add(uses=MyExecutor)


def print_why(resp, exception):
    print(resp.status.description)


with f:
    f.post('', on_error=print_why)
```

```console
[...]
executor0/rep-0@28271[E]:NotImplementedError('no time for it')
 add "--quiet-error" to suppress the exception details
[...]
  File "/home/joan/jina/jina/jina/serve/executors/decorators.py", line 115, in arg_wrapper
    return fn(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/home/joan/jina/jina/toy.py", line 8, in foo
    raise NotImplementedError('no time for it')
NotImplementedError: no time for it
NotImplementedError('no time for it')
```

## Example

Let's understand how `Executor`s process `DocumentArray`s inside a Flow, and how the changes are chained and applied, affecting downstream `Executors` in the Flow.


```python
from docarray import DocumentArray, Document
from jina import Executor, requests, Flow


class PrintDocuments(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        for doc in docs:
            print(f' PrintExecutor: received document with text: "{doc.text}"')


class ProcessDocuments(Executor):
    @requests(on='/change_in_place')
    def in_place(self, docs, **kwargs):
        # This executor will only work on `docs` and will not consider any other arguments
        for doc in docs:
            print(f' ProcessDocuments: received document with text "{doc.text}"')
            doc.text = 'I changed the executor in place'

    @requests(on='/return_different_docarray')
    def ret_docs(self, docs, **kwargs):
        # This executor will only work on `docs` and will not consider any other arguments
        ret = DocumentArray()
        for doc in docs:
            print(f' ProcessDocuments: received document with text: "{doc.text}"')
            ret.append(Document(text='I returned a different Document'))
        return ret


f = Flow().add(uses=ProcessDocuments).add(uses=PrintDocuments)

with f:
    f.post(on='/change_in_place', inputs=DocumentArray(Document(text='request')))
    f.post(
        on='/return_different_docarray', inputs=DocumentArray(Document(text='request'))
    )
```
