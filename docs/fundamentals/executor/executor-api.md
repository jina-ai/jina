(executor)=


# Basics


```{tip}
Executor uses `docarray.DocumentArray` as input and output data structure. Please first [read DocArray's docs](https://docarray.jina.ai) to get an impression how does it work.   
```

{class}`~jina.Executor` is a self-contained component and performs a group of tasks on a `DocumentArray`. 
It encapsulates functions that process `DocumentArray`s. Inside the Executor, these functions are decorated with `@requests`. To create an Executor, you only need to follow three principles:

1. An Executor should subclass directly from the `jina.Executor` class. Executor can also be a `dataclass`
2. An Executor class is a bag of functions with shared state or configuration (via `self`); it can contain an arbitrary number of
functions with arbitrary names.
3. Functions decorated by {class}`~jina.requests` will be invoked according to their `on=` endpoint. These functions can be coroutines (`async def`) or regular functions.

## Constructor

### Subclass

Every new executor should be a subclass of {class}`~jina.Executor`.

You can name your executor class freely.

### `__init__`

No need to implement `__init__` if your Executor does not contain initial states or if it is a [dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)

If your executor has `__init__`, it needs to carry `**kwargs` in the signature and call `super().__init__(**kwargs)` 
in the body:
````{tab} Executor
```python
from jina import Executor


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    def __init__(self, foo: str, bar: int, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.bar = bar
        self.foo = foo
```
````

````{tab} Executor as dataclass
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from jina import Executor


@dataclass
class MyExecutor(Executor):
    bar: int
    foo: str
```
````

````{admonition} What is inside kwargs? 
:class: hint
Here, `kwargs` are reserved for Jina to inject `metas` and `requests` (representing the request-to-function mapping) values when the Executor is used inside a Flow. Also when `Executor` is a `dataclass` these parameters are injected by Jina as in the regular case when calling `super().__init__`

You can access the values of these arguments in the `__init__` body via `self.metas`/`self.requests`/`self.runtime_args`, 
or modify their values before passing them to `super().__init__()`.
````

## Destructor

You might need to execute some logic when your Executor's destructor is called.

For example, you want to persist data to the disk (e.g. in-memory indexed data, fine-tuned model,...). 
To do so, you can overwrite the {meth}`~jina.serve.executors.BaseExecutor.close` method and add your logic.

Jina will make sure that the {meth}`~jina.serve.executors.BaseExecutor.close` method is executed when the Executor is terminated inside a {class}`~jina.Flow` or when deployed in any cloud-native environment.

You can think of this as Jina using the Executor as a context manager, making sure that the {meth}`~jina.serve.executors.BaseExecutor.close` method is always executed.

```python
from jina import Executor


class MyExec(Executor):
    def close(self):
        print('closing...')
```





## Attributes

When implementing an Executor, if your Executor overrides `__init__`, it needs to carry `**kwargs` in the signature and call `super().__init__(**kwargs)`
                                 
```python
from jina import Executor


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    def __init__(self, foo: str, bar: int, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.bar = bar
        self.foo = foo
```

This is important because when an Executor is instantiated in the context of a Flow, Jina is adding extra arguments.
Some of these `arguments` can be used when developing the internal logic of the Executor.

These `special` arguments are `workspace`, `requests`, `metas`, `runtime_args`.

Another alternative, is to declare your `Executor` as a [dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). In this case, user does not provide an specific constructor. 
Then, Jina will inject all these `special` arguments without the need of the user to call any specific method.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from jina import Executor


@dataclass
class MyExecutor(Executor):
    bar: int
    foo: str
```

(executor-workspace)=
### `workspace`

Each Executor has a special *workspace* that is reserved for that specific Executor instance.
The `.workspace` property contains the path to this workspace.

This `workspace` is based on the workspace passed when adding the Executor: `flow.add(..., workspace='path/to/workspace/')`.
The final `workspace` is generated by appending `'/<executor_name>/<shard_id>/'`.

This can be provided to the Executor via the {ref}`Python or YAML API <executor-api>`.

`````{dropdown} Default workspace

If the user hasn't provided a workspace, the Executor uses a default workspace, which is defined in the `JINA_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_BASE`
environment variable.

````{admonition} Caution
:class: caution
After you install jina, the `JINA_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_BASE` environment variable will be set in your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or
`.fish` file.

To change the default Executor workspace on your system, you can change the value of this environment variable.
However, if you directly edit the corresponding command in your `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc`/`.fish`) file, your changes will be reverted the next time
you install jina on your system.

Instead, you can add `export JINA_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_BASE=$YOUR_WOKSPACE` after the `# JINA_CLI_END` comment.
````

(executor-requests)=
### `requests`

By default, an Executor object contains {attr}`~.jina.serve.executors.BaseExecutor.requests` as an attribute when loaded from the Flow. This attribute is a `Dict` describing the mapping between Executor methods and network endpoints: It holds endpoint strings as keys, and pointers to functions as values. 

These can be provided to the Executor via the {ref}`Python or YAML API <executor-api>`.

(executor-metas)=
### `metas`

An Executor object contains {attr}`~.jina.serve.executors.BaseExecutor.metas` as an attribute when loaded from the Flow. It is of [`SimpleNamespace`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.SimpleNamespace) type and contains some key-value information. 

The list of the `metas` are:

- `name`: Name given to the Executor;
- `description`: Description of the Executor (optional, reserved for future-use in auto-docs);
- `py_modules`: List of Python modules needed to import the Executor. It can be Python package path e.g. `foo.bar.package.module` or file path to the modules needed to import the Executor.


These can be provided to the Executor via the {ref}`Python or YAML API <executor-api>`.

### `runtime_args`

By default, an Executor object contains {attr}`~.jina.serve.executors.BaseExecutor.runtime_args` as an attribute when loaded from the Flow. It is of [`SimpleNamespace`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.SimpleNamespace) type and contains information in key-value format. 
As the name suggests, `runtime_args` are dynamically determined during runtime, meaning that you don't know the value before running the Executor. These values are often related to the system/network environment around the Executor, and less about the Executor itself, like `shard_id` and `replicas`. They are usually set with the {meth}`~jina.orchestrate.flow.base.Flow.add` method.

The list of the `runtime_args` is:

- `name`: Name given to the Executor. This is dynamically adapted from the `name` in `metas` and depends on some additional arguments like `shard_id`. 
- `replicas`: Number of {ref}`replicas <replicate-executors>` of the same Executor deployed with the Flow.
- `shards`: Number of {ref}`shards <partition-data-by-using-shards>` of the same Executor deployed with the Flow.
- `shard_id`: Identifier of the `shard` corresponding to the given Executor instance.
- `workspace`: Path to be used by the Executor. Note that the actual workspace directory used by the Executor is obtained by appending `'/<executor_name>/<shard_id>/'` to this value.
- `py_modules`: Python package path e.g. `foo.bar.package.module` or file path to the modules needed to import the Executor. This is another way to pass `py-modules` to the Executor from the Flow

These can **not** be provided by the user through any API. They are generated by the Flow orchestration.
