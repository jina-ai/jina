Jina Enhancement Proposals (JEP)
********************************




What is a JEP?
==============

JEP stands for Jina Enhancement Proposal. A JEP is a design document providing information to the JIna community, or describing a new feature for Jina or its processes or environment. The JEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We learn from the `PEP standard <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/#what-is-a-pep>`_ and intend JEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. The JEP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.



Who should write JEP?
---------------------

The JEP process begins with a new idea for Jina. It is highly recommended that a single JEP contain a single key proposal or new idea. Small enhancements or patches often don't need a JEP and can be injected into the Jina development workflow with a Github submission to the Jina issue tracker.

The following scenarios may require a JEP:

- Adding a new module that affects how Jina works or interacts with users;
- Refactoring multiple modules and touched more than 500 lines of codes;
- Changing the core part of Jina and it will hurt the backward comparability.


JEP File Format
---------------
JEPs are UTF-8 encoded text files using the `reStructuredText format <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/#id19>`_. ReStructuredText allows for rich markup that is still quite easy to read, but also results in good-looking and functional HTML.
