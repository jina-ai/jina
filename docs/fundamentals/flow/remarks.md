## Joining/Merging

Combining `docs` from multiple requests is already done by the `ZEDRuntime` before feeding them to the Executor's
function. Hence, simple joining is just returning this `docs`. Complicated joining should be implemented at `Document`
/`DocumentArray`

```python
from jina import Executor, requests, Flow, Document


class C(Executor):

    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        # 6 docs
        return docs


class B(Executor):

    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        # 3 docs
        for idx, d in enumerate(docs):
            d.text = f'hello {idx}'


class A(Executor):

    @requests
    def A(self, docs, **kwargs):
        # 3 docs
        for idx, d in enumerate(docs):
            d.text = f'world {idx}'


f = Flow().add(uses=A).add(uses=B, needs='gateway').add(uses=C, needs=['executor0', 'executor1'])

with f:
    f.post(on='/some_endpoint',
           inputs=[Document() for _ in range(3)],
           on_done=print)
```

You can also modify the Documents while merging:

```python
class C(Executor):

    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        # 6 docs
        for d in docs:
            d.text += '!!!'
        return docs
```
