    ````{tab} via Docker
    ```shell
    docker pull jinaai/jina:latest
    ```
    ````

2. That’s it! Try a hello-world demo
   ````{tab} Run natively
   ```shell
   jina hello fashion
   ```
   ````
   ````{tab} Run in Docker
   ```shell
   docker run -v "$(pwd)/j:/j" jinaai/jina:latest hello fashion --workdir /j && open j/demo.html
   ```
   ````

Now that you’re set up, let’s dive into more of how Jina works and how to build great apps.
