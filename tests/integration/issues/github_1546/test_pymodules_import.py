        - the ``executor/__init__.py`` contains 
          ``from .my_executor import GoodCrafterNew``, which makes sure the
          custom executor class gets registered

    This is a valid structure, but not recommended:
        - "my_cust_module" is a python module
        - all core logic of your customized executor goes to ``__init__.py``
        - to import ``foo.py``, you should use relative import, e.g. ``from .foo import bar``

    This is not a recommended structure because:
        - putting core logic inside ``__init__.py`` is not how python packages
          are usually written
        - Importing from the workspace disables you from trying out the executor in
          the console, or test files at the root of the workspace, making development
          more cumbersome
        - the main directory is now cluttered with python files
        - extracting all python files to a separate directory is how python packages
          are usually composed
