# Share Executors via Hub
Jina Hub is a one-stop shop for Executors. By using Hub you can pull prebuilt Executors to dramatically reduce the 
effort and complexity needed in your search system, or push your own custom Executors to share privately or publicly.

Sharing an Executor consists of the following steps:

1) {ref}`Create a hub Executor <create-hub-executor>`
1) {ref}`Push Executor <push-executor>`
1) Hubble builds and publish the executor
1) {ref}`Pull <pull-executor>` and {ref}`use <use-hub-executor>` Executor
