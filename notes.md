### Done

From top to bottom

| What                       | Why                                                           |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bigger logo                | Catch eye. Common in trending repos                           |
| Redo slogan                | Shorter, punchier, bigger                                     |
| Add Slack badge            | Show how many users; get ppl to join immediately              |
| Add downloads badge        | Show off our many downloads                                   |
| Remove CI failing badge    | Makes us look not-great                                       |
| Remove codecov badge       | It's not 100%. Makes us look not-great                        |
| Elevator pitch tweak       | Focus on the what, now how. Use `media` bc more familiar word |
| Animations to the top      | Show Jina in action; catch eye                                |
| Why Jina bullets           | Verb-oriented - more action item-y                            |
| Installation simplify      | Table was overwhelming                                        |
| The big long feature list  | Removed. It belongs somewhere else, **not** in the readme     |
| Re-add basics(?)           | They disappeared somewhere in the mess                        |
| Basics, run demo sections  | Super simple intro stuff                                      |
| Remove documentation image | It wasn't paying its rent                                     |

### Todo

| What                    | Why                                      | Why not done yet?                             |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Better animation        | Maybe as one slideshow gif. Look nicer   | Need time/creative support                    |
| Wording polish          | Clarity, persuasion                      | Product support needed                        |
| Fix demo links          | Show working demos                       | We don't yet have demo's domain or live demos |
| Check CRUD, etc in docs | CRUD, etc section wasn't paying its rent | Need time to check and/or docs team to write  |
