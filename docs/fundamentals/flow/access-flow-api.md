# Access Flow API

Once you have {ref}`configured your Flow API <flow-api>` you can access it over the network.
There are multiple ways of doing this.

## Jina Client

```{admonition} See Also
:class: seealso

For a more detailed description of the Jina Client, see its dedicated {ref}`documentation page <client>`.
```

Jina offers a built-in client that supports gRPC, HTTP, and Websocket connections to a Flow.
Sending a request to a Flow is as simple as calling the `.post()` method:

````{tab} gRPC

```{code-block} python
from docarray import Document, DocumentArray
from jina import Client

# Flow exposed on host HOST and port PORT
c = Client(host=HOST, port=PORT)
response_docs = c.post(on='/search', inputs=DocumentArray())
```
````

````{tab} HTTP
```{code-block} python
from docarray import Document, DocumentArray
from jina import Client

# Flow exposed on host HOST and port PORT
c = Client(host=HOST, port=PORT, protocol='http')
response_docs = c.post(on='/search', inputs=DocumentArray())
```
````

````{tab} WebSocket

```{code-block} python
from docarray import Document, DocumentArray
from jina import Client

# Flow exposed on host HOST and port PORT
c = Client(host=HOST, port=PORT, protocol='websocket')
response_docs = c.post(on='/search', inputs=DocumentArray())
```
````

The Client also supports a number of additional features, such as batching requests, callback functions, asynchronous calls,
passing additional parameters, and {ref}`more <client>`.

## HTTP access

```{admonition} Available Protocols
:class: caution
Jina Flows can use one of three protocols: gRPC, HTTP, or Websocket. Only Flows that use HTTP can be accessed via the
methods described below.
```

Outside of using the Jina Client, various forms of sending HTTP requests are the most common way of interacting with a Flow.

You can always use `post` to interact with a Flow, using the `/post` HTTP endpoint.
Your HTTP request can include the following parameters:

- `execEndpoint` - required: Executor endpoint string to target.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>
    ```
    "execEndpoint": "/index"
    ```
</details>

- `data` - optional: List specifying the input Documents.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>
    ```
    "data": [{"text": "hello"}, {"text": "world"]
    ```
</details>

- `paramters` - optional: Dictionary of parameters to be sent to the Executors.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>
    ```
    "parameters": {"param1": "hello world"}
    ```
</details>

- `targetExecutor` - optional: String indicating an Executor to target. Default targets all Executors.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>
    ```
    "targetExecutor": "MyExec"
    ```
</details>

Instead of using the generic `/post` endpoint, you can directly use endpoints like `/index` or `/search`.
In this case your data request will be sent to the corresponding Executor endpoint, so the parameter `execEndpoint` does not need to be specified.

In any case, the response you receive will include `data` (and array of Documents), as well as the fields `routes`, `parameters`, and `header`.

```{admonition} Flow REST API
:class: seealso
For a more detailed descripton of the REST API of a generic Flow, including the complete request body schema and request samples, see [here](https://api.jina.ai/rest/).

For a specific deployed Flow, you can get the same overview by accessing the `/redoc` endpoint.
```

(swagger-ui)=
### Use Swagger UI to send HTTP request

Flows provide a customized [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) which can be used to interact with the Flow
visually, through a web browser.

```{admonition} Available Protocols
:class: caution
Only Flows that have {ref}`cors <cors>` enabled expose a Swagger UI interface.
```

For a Flow that is exposed on port `PORT`, you can navigate to the Swagger UI via `http://localhost:PORT/docs`:

```{figure} ../../../.github/2.0/swagger-ui.png
:align: center
```
Here you can see all the endpoints that are exposed by the Flow, such as `/search` and `/index`.

To send a request, click on the endpoint you want to target, then on `try it out`.
\
Now you can enter your HTTP request, and send it by clicking on `Execute`.

You should see the raw response, together with a visual representation of the returned Documents.

### Use HTTP client to send request

You can send data requests to a Flow via cURL, Postman, or any other HTTP client.

<details>
  <summary>cURL example</summary>

    ```console
    $ curl --request POST 'http://localhost:12345/post' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"data": [{"text": "hello world"}],"execEndpoint": "/index"}'
