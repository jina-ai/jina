## Variables

Jina Flow YAML supports variables and variable substitution according to the [GitHub Actions syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables):

### Environment variables

Use `${{ ENV.VAR }}` to refer to the environment variable `VAR`. You can find all {ref}`Jina environment variables here<jina-env-vars>`.

### Context variables

Use `${{ CONTEXT.VAR }}` to refer to the context variable `VAR`.
Context variables can be passed to `f.load_config(..., context=...)` in the form of a Python dictionary.

### Relative paths

Use `${{root.path.to.var}}` to refer to the variable `var` within the same YAML file, found at the provided path in the file's structure.
Note that the only difference between environment variable syntax and relative path syntax is the omission of spaces in the latter.
