# Remarks


## Joining/Merging

Combining `docs` from multiple requests is already done by the `ZEDRuntime` before feeding them to the Executor's
function. Hence, simple joining is just returning this `docs`. Complicated joining should be implemented at `Document`
/`DocumentArray`

```python
from jina import Executor, requests, Flow, Document


class C(Executor):

    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        # 6 docs
        return docs


class B(Executor):

    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        # 3 docs
        for idx, d in enumerate(docs):
            d.text = f'hello {idx}'


class A(Executor):

    @requests
    def A(self, docs, **kwargs):
        # 3 docs
        for idx, d in enumerate(docs):
            d.text = f'world {idx}'


f = Flow().add(uses=A).add(uses=B, needs='gateway').add(uses=C, needs=['executor0', 'executor1'])

with f:
    f.post(on='/some_endpoint',
           inputs=[Document() for _ in range(3)],
           on_done=print)
```

You can also modify the Documents while merging:

```python
class C(Executor):

    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        # 6 docs
        for d in docs:
            d.text += '!!!'
        return docs
```


## multiprocessing Spawn

Few cases require to use `spawn` start method for multiprocessing. 
(e.g.- Cannot re-initialize CUDA in forked subprocess. To use CUDA with multiprocessing, you must use the 'spawn' start method)

- Please set `JINA_MP_START_METHOD=spawn` before starting the Python script to enable this.

    ````{hint}
    There's no need to set this for Windows, as it only supports spawn method for multiprocessing. 
    ````

- Define & start the Flow via an explicit function call inside `if __name__ == '__main__'`. For example

- **Avoid un-picklable objects**

    [Here's a list of types that can be pickled in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#what-can-be-pickled-and-unpickled). Since `spawn` relies on pickling, we should avoid using code that cannot be pickled.

    ````{hint}
    Here are a few errors which indicates that you are using some code that is not pickable.

    ```bash
    pickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle: it's not the same object
    AssertionError: can only join a started process
    ```

    ````

    Inline functions, such as nested or lambda functions are not picklable. Use `functools.partial` instead.

- **Always provide absolute path**

    While passing filepaths to different jina arguments (e.g.- `uses`, `py_modules`), always pass the absolute path.





## Debugging Executor in a Flow

Standard Python breakpoints will not work inside `Executor` methods when called inside a Flow context manager. Nevertheless, `import epdb; epdb.set_trace()` will work just as a native python breakpoint. Note that you need to `pip instal epdb` to have acces to this type of breakpoints.
