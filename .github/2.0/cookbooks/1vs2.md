# 5 Reasons to Use Jina 2.0

## 1. 2.0 is as Easy as 1, 2, 3

Learning Jina 2.0 is as simple as 1, 2, 3. With only three main concepts - Document, Flow, and Executor - you'll get up to speed in no time. Know them all, nothing more, and you're good to go!

## 2. 2.0 is Faster

Compared to 1.x (`1.4.2`), 2.0 is 
- 20% faster on startup;
- 20% faster on `import`;
- 5% faster on empty Flow.

## 3. 2.0 Gives YOU the Power

Jina 1.0 was a complex beast with lots of boilerplate code and not so much transparency. In 2.0 we're putting the power back in your hands. Want to write your own `.logger`, `.save()`, `.load()` or context manager interface for your Executor? Now that power is yours.

## 4. 2.0 is More Pythonic

In Jina 2.0 Documents and DocumentArrays are first-class citizens and fully Pythonic data types. With no more Drivers, you can manipulate Documents directly with all the power that entails:

```python
from jina import Document

d = Document(content='hello',
             uri='https://jina.ai',
             mime_type='text/plain',
             granularity=1,
             adjacency=3,
             tags={'foo': 'bar'})
```

</details>

## 5. 2.0 is Lighter

Jina has gone on a diet for 2.0. Say goodbye to Drivers and those extraneous imports, classes and metas. Instead, you can focus on the stuff you care about - the Documents you feed in and get out, the Executors that process them, and the Flow that organizes the whole thing.
