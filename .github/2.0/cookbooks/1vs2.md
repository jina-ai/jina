# 5 Reasons to Use Jina 2.0

## 2.0 is as Easy as 1, 2, 3

Learning Jina 2.0 is as simple as 1, 2, 3. With only three main concepts - Document, Flow, and Executor - you'll get up to speed in no time. Know them all, nothing more, and you're good to go!

## 2.0 is Faster

Compared to 1.x (`1.4.2`), 2.0 is 
- 220% faster on startup;
- 220% faster on `import`;
- 5% faster on empty Flow.

## 2.0 Gives YOU the Power

Jina 1.0 was a complex beast with lots of boilerplate code and not so much transparency. In 2.0 we're putting the power back in your hands. Want to write your own `.logger`, `.save()`, or `.load()`? Now that power is yours.

## 2.0 is More Pythonic

Jina 2.0 embraces explicit above implicit: No more Drivers. You can manipulate Documents in custom Executors directly with all the power that entails:

```python
from jina import Document, DocumentArray, Executor, requests

class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    def add_world(self, docs: DocumentArray):
        for doc in docs:
            doc.text += 'world'
```

## 2.0 is Lighter

Jina has gone on a diet for 2.0. We've dramatically cut the layers of abstraction, removing Drivers and de-emphasizing Peas and Pods to give you a simpler, more elegant Flow experience. 

Instead, you can focus on the stuff you care about - the Documents you feed in and get out, the Executors that process them, and the Flow that organizes the whole thing.
