## Getting Started

The simplest way to use Jina is via Docker. We provide a universal container image as small as 100MB that can be run on multiple architectures (e.g. x64, x86, arm-64/v7/v6). Of course, you need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/) first. 

### Running Jina Image

```bash
docker run jinaai/jina:master-debian
```

This command downloads the latest Jina image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jinaai/jina/tags) based on your local architecture and then runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an help message and exits.

#### Github Package (Do not support multiarch)

```bash
docker login -u USERNAME -p TOKEN docker.pkg.github.com
docker run docker.pkg.github.com/jina-ai/jina/jina:[tag]
```

#### Tencent Cloud (Too slow to upload)

```bash
docker login -u USERNAME -p TOKEN ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com
docker run ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/jina/jina:[tag]
```
</details>

### Running Jina Natively

If you prefer the classic way to run Jina natively on the host, please make sure you have Python >= 3.7 installed on the host. 

#### Install from PyPi
 
```bash
pip install jina
```

#### Or, Install from the Master Branch

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jina-ai/jina.git
```

#### Or, (Dev/Editable mode) Install from Your Local Folk/Clone 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/jina
cd jina && pip install -e .
``` 

> Note, if you later want to switch to the other ways of Jina installation, remember to first uninstall your editable version from the system:
  ```bash
  pip uninstall $(basename $(find . -name '*.egg-info') .egg-info)
  ```

## Testing

To verify the installation:

```bash
docker run jinaai/jina:master-debian check

# or if you installed Jina locally
jina check
```

It prints a list of components the current Jina supported and exits.

If you cloned this repository to local, then you can perform unittest via:

```bash
cd tests && python -m unittest *.py -v
```
  
## Documentation 

The generated HTML files are hosted in [`jina-ai/jina-docs`](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-docs).

Documentation is built on every push, merge, and release event of the master branch. 
 
To build the documentation locally, you need to have Docker installed. Clone this repository and run the following command: 

```bash
bash ./make-doc.sh serve 8080
```

The documentation is then available via browser at `http://0.0.0.0:8080/`.
