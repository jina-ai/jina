# Add Executors

A {class}`~jina.Flow` orchestrates its {class}`~jina.Executor`s as a graph and sends requests to all Executors in the
order specified by {meth}`~jina.Flow.add` or listed in {ref}`a YAML file<flow-yaml-spec>`.

When you start a Flow, Executors always run in **separate processes**. Multiple Executors run in **different processes
**. Multiprocessing is the lowest level of separation when you run a Flow locally. When running a Flow on Kubernetes,
Docker Swarm, {ref}`jcloud`, different Executors run in different containers, pods or instances.

## Add Executors sequentially

Executors can be added into a Flow with {meth}`~jina.Flow.add`.

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add()
```

This adds an "empty" Executor called {class}`~jina.serve.executors.BaseExecutor` to the Flow. This Executor (without any
parameters) performs no actions.

```{figure} no-op-flow.svg
:scale: 70%
```

To more easily identify an Executor, you can change its name by passing the `name` parameter:

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add(name='myVeryFirstExecutor').add(name='secondIsBest')
```

```{figure} named-flow.svg
:scale: 70%
```

You can also define the above Flow in YAML:

```yaml
jtype: Flow
executors:
  - name: myVeryFirstExecutor
  - name: secondIsBest
```

Save it as `flow.yml` and run it:

```bash
jina flow --uses flow.yml
```

More Flow YAML specifications can be found in {ref}`Flow YAML Specification<flow-yaml-spec>`.

## Define topologies over Executors

{class}`~jina.Flow`s are not restricted to sequential execution. Internally they are modeled as graphs, so they can
represent any complex, non-cyclic topology.

A typical use case for such a Flow is a topology with a common pre-processing part, but different indexers separating
embeddings and data.

To define a custom topology you can use the `needs` keyword when adding an {class}`~jina.Executor`. By default, a Flow
assumes that every Executor needs the previously added Executor.

```python
from jina import Executor, Flow, requests, Document, DocumentArray


class FooExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    async def foo(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        docs.append(Document(text=f'foo was here and got {len(docs)} document'))


class BarExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    async def bar(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        docs.append(Document(text=f'bar was here and got {len(docs)} document'))


class BazExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    async def baz(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        docs.append(Document(text=f'baz was here and got {len(docs)} document'))


f = (
    Flow()
    .add(uses=FooExecutor, name='fooExecutor')
    .add(uses=BarExecutor, name='barExecutor', needs='fooExecutor')
    .add(uses=BazExecutor, name='bazExecutor', needs='fooExecutor')
    .add(needs=['barExecutor', 'bazExecutor'])
)
```

```{figure} needs-flow.svg
:width: 70%
:align: center
Complex Flow where one Executor requires two Executors to process Documents beforehand
```

When sending message to this Flow,

```python
with f:
    print(f.post('/').texts)
```

This gives the output:

```text
['foo was here and got 0 document', 'bar was here and got 1 document', 'baz was here and got 1 document']
```

Both `BarExecutor` and `BazExecutor` only received a single `Document` from `FooExecutor` because they are run in
parallel. The last Executor `executor3` receives both DocumentArrays and merges them automatically.
This automated merging can be disabled with `no_reduce=True`. This is useful for providing custom merge logic in a
separate Executor. In this case the last `.add()` call would look
like `.add(needs=['barExecutor', 'bazExecutor'], uses=CustomMergeExecutor, no_reduce=True)`. This feature requires
Jina >= 3.0.2.

## How Executors process DocumentArrays in a Flow

Let's understand how Executors process DocumentArray's inside a Flow, and how changes are chained and applied, affecting
downstream Executors in the Flow.

```python 
from jina import Executor, requests, Flow, DocumentArray, Document


class PrintDocuments(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        for doc in docs:
            print(f' PrintExecutor: received document with text: "{doc.text}"')


class ProcessDocuments(Executor):
    @requests(on='/change_in_place')
    def in_place(self, docs, **kwargs):
        # This Executor only works on `docs` and doesn't consider any other arguments
        for doc in docs:
            print(f' ProcessDocuments: received document with text "{doc.text}"')
            doc.text = 'I changed the executor in place'

    @requests(on='/return_different_docarray')
    def ret_docs(self, docs, **kwargs):
        # This executor only works on `docs` and doesn't consider any other arguments
        ret = DocumentArray()
        for doc in docs:
            print(f' ProcessDocuments: received document with text: "{doc.text}"')
            ret.append(Document(text='I returned a different Document'))
        return ret


f = Flow().add(uses=ProcessDocuments).add(uses=PrintDocuments)

with f:
    f.post(on='/change_in_place', inputs=DocumentArray(Document(text='request1')))
    f.post(
        on='/return_different_docarray', inputs=DocumentArray(Document(text='request2'))
    )
```

## Define Executor with `uses`

An {class}`~jina.Executor`'s type is defined by the `uses` keyword. Note that some usages are not supported on JCloud
due to security reasons and the nature of facilitating local debugging.

| Local Dev | JCloud | `.add(uses=...)`                                     | Description                                                                                                 |

````{admonition} Hint: Load multiple Executors from the same directory
:class: hint

You don't need to specify the parent directory for each Executor.
Instead, you can configure a common search path for all Executors:

```
.

````

(flow-configure-executors)=

## Configure Executors

You can set and override {class}`~jina.Executor` configuration when adding them to a {class}`~jina.Flow`.

This example shows how to start a Flow with an Executor using the Python API:

```python
from jina import Flow

with Flow().add(
    uses='MyExecutor',
    uses_with={"parameter_1": "foo", "parameter_2": "bar"},
    py_modules=["executor.py"],
    uses_metas={
        "name": "MyExecutor",
        "description": "MyExecutor does a thing to the stuff in your Documents",
    },
    uses_requests={"/index": "my_index", "/search": "my_search", "/random": "foo"},
    workspace="some_custom_path",
) as f:
    ...
```

- `uses_with` is a key-value map that defines the {ref}`arguments of the Executor'<executor-args>` `__init__` method.
- `uses_requests` is a key-value map that defines the {ref}`mapping from endpoint to class method<executor-requests>`.
  This is useful to overwrite the default endpoint-to-method mapping defined in the Executor python implementation.
- `workspace` is a string that defines the {ref}`workspace <executor-workspace>`.
- `py_modules` is a list of strings that defines the Executor's Python dependencies;
- `uses_metas` is a key-value map that defines some of the Executor's {ref}`internal attributes<executor-metas>`. It
  contains the following fields:
    - `name` is a string that defines the name of the Executor;
    - `description` is a string that defines the description of this Executor. It is used in the automatic docs UI;

### Set `with` via `uses_with`

To set/override an Executor's `with` configuration, use `uses_with`. The `with` configuration refers to user-defined
constructor kwargs.

```python
from jina import Executor, requests, Flow


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    def __init__(self, param1=1, param2=2, param3=3, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
        self.param3 = param3

    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        print('param1:', self.param1)
        print('param2:', self.param2)
        print('param3:', self.param3)


flow = Flow().add(uses=MyExecutor, uses_with={'param1': 10, 'param3': 30})
with flow as f:
    f.post('/')
```

```text
      executor0@219662[L]:ready and listening

	🌐 Public address:	197.28.82.165:32825
param1: 10
param2: 2
param3: 30
```

### Set `requests` via `uses_requests`

You can set/override an Executor's `requests` configuration and bind methods to custom endpoints.
In the following code:

- We replace the endpoint `/foo` bound to the `foo()` function with both `/non_foo` and `/alias_foo`.
- We add a new endpoint `/bar` for binding `bar()`.

Note the `all_req()` function is bound to **all** endpoints except those explicitly bound to other functions,
i.e. `/non_foo`, `/alias_foo` and `/bar`.

```python
from jina import Executor, requests, Flow


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    def all_req(self, parameters, **kwargs):
        print(f'all req {parameters.get("recipient")}')

    @requests(on='/foo')
    def foo(self, parameters, **kwargs):
        print(f'foo {parameters.get("recipient")}')

    def bar(self, parameters, **kwargs):
        print(f'bar {parameters.get("recipient")}')


flow = Flow().add(
    uses=MyExecutor,
    uses_requests={
        '/bar': 'bar',
        '/non_foo': 'foo',
        '/alias_foo': 'foo',
    },
)
with flow as f:
    f.post('/bar', parameters={'recipient': 'bar()'})
    f.post('/non_foo', parameters={'recipient': 'foo()'})
    f.post('/foo', parameters={'recipient': 'all_req()'})
    f.post('/alias_foo', parameters={'recipient': 'foo()'})
```

```text
      executor0@221058[L]:ready and listening

```

### Set `metas` via `uses_metas`

To set/override an Executor's `metas` configuration, use `uses_metas`:

```python
from jina import Executor, requests, Flow


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        print(self.metas.name)


flow = Flow().add(
    uses=MyExecutor,
    uses_metas={'name': 'different_name'},
)
with flow as f:
    f.post('/')
```

```text
      executor0@219291[L]:ready and listening
        gateway@219291[L]:ready and listening
           Flow@219291[I]:🎉 Flow is ready to use!

	🏠 Local access:	0.0.0.0:58827
	🔒 Private network:	192.168.1.101:58827
different_name
```

### Unify output `ndarray` types

Different {class}`~jina.Executor`s in a {class}`~jina.Flow` may depend on different `types` for array-like data such
as `doc.tensor` and `doc.embedding`,
often because they were written with different machine learning frameworks.
As the builder of a Flow you don't always have control over this, for example when using Executors from Executor Hub.

To ease the integration of different Executors, a Flow allows you to convert `tensor` and `embedding`
by using the `f.add(..., output_array_type=..)`:

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add(uses=MyExecutor, output_array_type='numpy').add(uses=NeedsNumpyExecutor)
```

This converts the `.tensor` and `.embedding` fields of all output Documents of `MyExecutor` to `numpy.ndarray`, making
the data
usable by `NeedsNumpyExecutor`. This works whether `MyExecutor` populates these fields with arrays/tensors from
PyTorch, TensorFlow, or any other popular ML framework.

````{admonition} Output types
:class: note

`output_array_type=` supports more types than `'numpy'`. For the full specification and further details, check the
[protobuf serialization docs](https://docarray.jina.ai/fundamentals/document/serialization/#from-to-protobuf).
````

(executor-grpc-server-options)=
### Configure Executor gRPC options

The {class}`~jina.Executor` supports the `grpc_server_options` parameter which allows more customization of the **gRPC**
server. The `grpc_server_options` parameter accepts a dictionary of **gRPC** configuration options which will be
used to overwrite the default options. The **gRPC** channel used for server to server communication can also be
customized using the `grpc_channel_options` parameter.

The default **gRPC** options are:

```
('grpc.max_send_message_length', -1),
('grpc.max_receive_message_length', -1),
('grpc.keepalive_time_ms', 9999),
# send keepalive ping every 9 second, default is 2 hours.
('grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms', 4999),
# keepalive ping time out after 4 seconds, default is 20 seconds
('grpc.keepalive_permit_without_calls', True),
# allow keepalive pings when there's no gRPC calls
('grpc.http1.max_pings_without_data', 0),
# allow unlimited amount of keepalive pings without data
('grpc.http1.min_time_between_pings_ms', 10000),
# allow grpc pings from client every 9 seconds
('grpc.http1.min_ping_interval_without_data_ms', 5000),
# allow grpc pings from client without data every 4 seconds
```

Refer to the [channel_arguments](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/python/glossary.html#term-channel_arguments) section for
the full list of available **gRPC** options.

```{hint}
:class: seealso
Refer to the {ref}`Configure gRPC Client options <client-grpc-channel-options>` section for configuring the `Client` **gRPC** channel options.
Refer to the {ref}`Configure Gateway gRPC options <gateway-grpc-channel-options>` section for configuring the `Gateway` **gRPC** options.
```

(external-executors)=

## Add external Executors

Usually a Flow starts and stops all of its own Executors. External Executors are owned by *other* Flows, meaning they
can reside on any machine and their lifetime are controlled by others.

Using external Executors is useful for sharing expensive Executors (like stateless, GPU-based encoders) between Flows.

Both {ref}`served and shared Executors <serve-executor-standalone>` can be used as external Executors.

When you add an external Executor to a Flow, you have to provide a `host` and `port`, and enable the `external` flag:

```python
from jina import Flow

Flow().add(host='123.45.67.89', port=12345, external=True)

# or

Flow().add(host='123.45.67.89:12345', external=True)
```

The Flow doesn't start or stop this Executor and assumes that it is externally managed and available
at `123.45.67.89:12345`.

Despite the lifetime control, the external Executor behaves just like a regular one. You can even add the same Executor
to multiple
Flows.

### Enable TLS

You can also use external Executors with `tls`:

```python
from jina import Flow

Flow().add(host='123.45.67.89:443', external=True, tls=True)
```

After that, the external Executor behaves just like an internal one. You can even add the same Executor to multiple
Flows.

```{hint} 
Using `tls` to connect to the External Executor is especially needed to use an external Executor deployed with JCloud. See the JCloud {ref}`documentation <jcloud>` for further details
```

### Pass arguments

External Executor may require extra configs to run.
Think about an Executor that requires authentication to run.
You can pass the `grpc_metadata` parameter to the Executor. `grpc_metadata` is a dictionary of key-value pairs to be
passed along with every gRPC request send to that Executor.

```python
from jina import Flow

Flow().add(
    host='123.45.67.89',
    port=443,
    external=True,
    grpc_metadata={'authorization': '<TOKEN>'},
)
```

```{hint}
The `grpc_metadata` parameter here follows the `metadata` concept in gRPC. See [gRPC documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#metadata) for details.
```

(floating-executors)=

## Add floating Executors

Some Executors in your Flow can be used for asynchronous background tasks that take time and don't generate a required
output. For instance,
logging specific information in external services, storing partial results, etc.

You can unblock your Flow from such tasks by using *floating Executors*.

Normally, all Executors form a pipeline that handles and transforms a given request until it is finally returned to the
Client.

However, floating Executors do not feed their outputs back into the pipeline. Therefore, the Executor's output does not
affect the response for the Client, and the response can be returned without waiting for the floating Executor to
complete its task.

Those Executors are marked with the `floating` keyword when added to a `Flow`:

```python
import time
from jina import Flow, Executor, requests, DocumentArray


class FastChangingExecutor(Executor):
    @requests()
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        for doc in docs:
            doc.text = 'Hello World'


class SlowChangingExecutor(Executor):
    @requests()
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        time.sleep(2)
        print(f' Received {docs.texts}')
        for doc in docs:
            doc.text = 'Change the document but will not affect response'


f = (
    Flow()
    .add(name='executor0', uses=FastChangingExecutor)
    .add(
        name='floating_executor',
        uses=SlowChangingExecutor,
        needs=['gateway'],
        floating=True,
    )
)
with f:
    f.post(on='/endpoint', inputs=DocumentArray.empty(1))  # we need to send a first
    start_time = time.time()
    response = f.post(on='/endpoint', inputs=DocumentArray.empty(2))
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f' Response time took {end_time - start_time}s')
    print(f' {response.texts}')
```

```text
 Response time took 0.011997222900390625s
 ['Hello World', 'Hello World']
 Received ['Hello World', 'Hello World']
```

In this example the response is returned without waiting for the floating Executor to complete. However, the Flow is not
closed until
the floating Executor has handled the request.

You can plot the Flow and see the Executor is floating disconnected from the **Gateway**.

```{figure} flow_floating.svg
:width: 70%

```

A floating Executor can *never* come before a non-floating Executor in your Flow's
{ref}`topology <flow-complex-topologies>`.

This leads to the following behaviors:

- **Implicit reordering**: When you add a non-floating Executor after a floating Executor without specifying its `needs`
  parameter, the non-floating Executor is chained after the previous non-floating one.

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add().add(name='middle', floating=True).add()
f.plot()
```

```{figure} flow_middle_1.svg
:width: 70%

```

- **Chaining floating Executors**: To chain more than one floating Executor, you need to add all of them with
  the `floating` flag, and explicitly specify the `needs` argument.

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add().add(name='middle', floating=True).add(needs=['middle'], floating=True)
f.plot()
```

```{figure} flow_chain_floating.svg
:width: 70%

```

- **Overriding the `floating` flag**: If you add a floating Executor as part of `needs` parameter of a non-floating
  Executor, then the floating Executor is no longer considered floating.

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add().add(name='middle', floating=True).add(needs=['middle'])
f.plot()
```

```{figure} flow_cancel_floating.svg
:width: 70%

```
