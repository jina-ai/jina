# Install Jina via `pip`

If you prefer to run Jina natively on your host, please make sure you have Python >= 3.7 installed.

## Install from PyPi

On Linux/Mac, simply run:
 
```bash
pip install jina
```

## Install from the Master Branch

If you want to keep track of the master branch of our development repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jina-ai/jina.git
```

Be aware that the master branch may not be stable. We only recommend this branch for testing new features.

## Install from Your Local Fork/Clone

If you are a developer and want to test your changes on-the-fly: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/jina
cd jina && pip install -e .
``` 

In the dev mode, if you later switch to a different method of Jina installation, remember to first uninstall the version you edited:

```bash
pip uninstall $(basename $(find . -name '*.egg-info') .egg-info)
```

## Cherry-Pick Extra Dependencies

Jina requires only five dependencies `numpy`, `pyzmq`, `protobuf`, `grpcio` and `pyyaml`. No third-party pre-trained models, deep learning/NLP/CV packages will be installed. 

However, some Executors may require extra dependencies. The full table of these extra dependencies can be found in `extra-requirements.txt`. You can cherry-pick what you want to install, e.g.

```bash
pip install "jina[nlp+cv]"
``` 

This will install all dependencies tagged with `nlp` or `cv`.

Though not recommended, you can install Jina with full dependencies via:

```bash
pip install "jina[all]"
``` 

### To Install Cherry-Picked Dependencies From the Master Branch

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/jina-ai/jina.git#egg=jina[http]" 
```

## On Windows

Currently we do not support native python on Windows.

If you are a Windows user, one workaround is to [run Jina on Windows Subsystem for Linux](on-wsl.md) or [run Jina in a Docker container](via-docker.md). If you manage to run Jina on Windows after some tweaks, please submit your changes [here](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/issues/new).

## Other OSes
Please refer to [run Jina in a Docker container](via-docker.md). If you manage to run Jina on other OSes after some tweaks, please submit your changes [here](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/issues/new).

# Upgrade Jina

If you have a previously installed version of Jina, you can upgrade it by running:

```bash
pip install -U jina
```

For Docker users: 

```bash
docker pull jinaai/jina
```
