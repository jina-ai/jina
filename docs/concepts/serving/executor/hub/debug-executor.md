````{admonition} Not applicable to containerized Executors
:class: caution
This does not work for containerized Executors.
````

In this tutorial you will learn how to debug [Hello Executor](https://cloud.jina.ai/executor/9o9yjq1q) step by step.

````{admonition} Make sure the schemas are known
:class: note

While using docarray>0.30.0, Executors do not have a fix schema and each Executor defines its own. Make sure you know
those schemas when using Executors from the Hub.
````

## Pull the Executor

Pull the source code of the Executor you want to debug:

````{tab} via Command Line Interface
```shell
jina hub pull jinaai://jina-ai/Hello
```
````
````{tab} via Python code
```python
from jina import Executor

Executor.from_hub('jinaai://jina-ai/Hello')
```
````

## Set breakpoints

In the `~/.jina/hub-package` directory there is one subdirectory for each Executor that you pulled, named by the Executor ID. You can find the Executor's source files in this directory.

Once you locate the source, you can set the breakpoints as you always do.

## Debug your code

You can debug your Executor like any Python code. You can either use the Executor on its own or inside a Deployment:

````{tab} Executor on its own
```python
from jina import Executor

exec = Executor.from_hub('jinaai://jina-ai/Hello')

# Set breakpoint as needed
exec.foo()
```
````
````{tab} Executor inside a Deployment
```python
from jina import Deployment
from docarray.documents.legacy import LegacyDocument

dep = Deployment(uses='jinaai://jina-ai/Hello')

with dep:
    res = dep.post('/', inputs=LegacyDocument(text='hello'), return_results=True)
    print(res)
```
````
