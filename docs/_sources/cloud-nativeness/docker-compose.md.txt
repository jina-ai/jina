# {fab}`docker` Docker Compose Support

One of the simplest ways to prototype or serve in
production is to run your {class}`~jina.Flow` with `docker-compose`.

A {class}`~jina.Flow` is composed of {class}`~jina.Executor`s which run Python code
that operates on `DocumentArray`. These `Executors` live in different runtimes depending on how you want to deploy
your Flow. 

By default, if you are serving your Flow locally they live within processes. Nevertheless, 
because Jina is cloud native your Flow can easily manage Executors that live in containers and that are
orchestrated by your favorite tools. One of the simplest is Docker Compose which is supported out of the box. 

You can deploy a Flow with Docker Compose in one line:


```{code-block} python
---
emphasize-lines: 3
---
from jina import Flow
flow = Flow(...).add(...).add(...)
flow.to_docker_compose_yaml('docker-compose.yml')
```

Jina generates a `docker-compose.yml` configuration file corresponding with your Flow. You can use this directly with 
Docker Compose, avoiding the overhead of manually defining all of your Flow's services.

````{admonition} Use Docker-based Executors
:class: caution
All Executors in the Flow should be used with `jinaai+docker://...` or `docker://...`.
````

````{admonition} Health check available from 3.1.3
:class: caution
If you use Executors that rely on Docker images built with a version of Jina prior to 3.1.3, remove the 
health check from the dumped YAML file, otherwise your Docker Compose services will 
always be "unhealthy."
````

````{admonition} Matching Jina versions
:class: caution
If you change the Docker images in your Docker Compose generated file, ensure that all services included in
the Gateway are built with the same Jina version to guarantee compatibility.

## Example: Index and search images using CLIPEncoder and ANNLiteIndexer

Install [`Docker Compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) locally to follow this how-to.

This example shows how to build and deploy a Flow with Docker Compose, using [`CLIPImageEncoder`](https://cloud.jina.ai/executor/0hnlmu3q)
as an image encoder and [`ANNLiteIndexer`](https://cloud.jina.ai/executor/7yypg8qk) as an indexer to perform fast nearest
neighbor retrieval on image embeddings.

### Deploy the Flow

First define the Flow and generate the Docker Compose YAML configuration:

````{tab} YAML
In a `flow.yml` file :
```yaml
jtype: Flow
with:
  port: 8080
  protocol: http
executors:
- name: encoder
  uses: jinaai+docker://jina-ai/CLIPEncoder
  replicas: 2
- name: indexer
  uses: jinaai+docker://jina-ai/AnnLiteIndexer
  uses_with:
    dim: 512
  shards: 2
```
Then in a shell run:
```shell
jina export docker-compose flow.yml docker-compose.yml 
```
````


````{tab} Python
In python run
```python
from jina import Flow

flow = (
    Flow(port=8080, protocol='http')
    .add(name='encoder', uses='jinaai+docker://jina-ai/CLIPEncoder', replicas=2)
    .add(
        name='indexer',
        uses='jinaai+docker://jina-ai/AnnLiteIndexer',
        uses_with={'dim': 512},
        shards=2,
    )
)
flow.to_docker_compose_yaml('docker-compose.yml')
```
````

````{admonition} Hint
:class: hint
You can use a custom jina Docker image for the Gateway service by setting the envrironment variable `JINA_GATEWAY_IMAGE` to the desired image before generating the configuration.
````

let's take a look at the generated compose file:
```yaml
version: '3.3'
...
services:
  encoder-rep-0:  # # # # # # # # # # #          
                  #     Encoder       #
  encoder-rep-1:  # # # # # # # # # # #

  indexer-head:   # # # # # # # # # # #          
                  #                   #
  indexer-0:      #     Indexer       #
                  #                   #
  indexer-1:      # # # # # # # # # # #

  gateway: 
    ...
    ports:
    - 8080:8080
```

```{tip} 
:class: caution
The default compose file generated by the Flow contains no special configuration or settings. You may want to 
adapt it to your own needs.
```

You can see that six services are created:

- 1 for the **Gateway** which is the entrypoint of the **Flow**.
- 2 associated with the encoder for the two Replicas.
- 3 associated with the indexer, one for the Head and two for the Shards.

Now, you can deploy this Flow :

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

### Query the Flow

Once we see that all the services in the Flow are ready, we can send index and search requests.

First define a client:
```python
from jina.clients import Client

client = Client(host='http://localhost:8080')
```

Then index the set of images we want to search:

```python
from docarray import DocumentArray

da = DocumentArray.pull('demo-da-images-jina', show_progress=True)

da_query = da[0:1]  # one document for query
da_index = da[1:]  # the rest is for indexing

indexed_docs = client.index(inputs=da_index)
print(f'Indexed Documents: {len(indexed_docs)}')
```

```shell
Indexed Documents: 99
```

We indexed 99 Documents!

Now we can search for the closest image to the query image:

```python
queried_docs = client.search(inputs=da_query)

matches = queried_docs[0].matches
print(f'Matched Documents: {len(matches)}')
```


```shell
Matched Documents: 10
```

This gives us the list of the ten closest images to the query.
