# Executor File Structure

Besides organizing your Executor code inline-ly (i.e. with `Flow.add()` in the same file), you can also write it as "extern" module and then use it via YAML. This is useful when your Executor's logic is too complicated to fit into a single file.

````{tab} Inline manner


```python
from jina import Executor, Flow, Document, requests


class MyExecutor(Executor):

    @requests
    def foo(self, **kwargs):
        print(kwargs)


f = Flow().add(uses=MyExecutor)

with f:
    f.post(on='/random_work', inputs=Document(), on_done=print)
```


````

`````{tab} Separate module

````{dropdown} foo.py


```python
from jina import Executor, Flow, Document, requests


class MyExecutor(Executor):

    @requests
    def foo(self, **kwargs):
        print(kwargs)


f = Flow().add(uses=MyExecutor)

with f:
    f.post(on='/random_work', inputs=Document(), on_done=print)
```

````


````{dropdown} my.yml

```yaml
jtype: MyExecutor
metas:
  py_modules:
    - foo.py
  name: awesomeness
  description: my first awesome executor
requests:
  /random_work: foo
```

````

````{dropdown} flow.py

```python
from jina import Flow, Document

f = Flow().add(uses='my.yml')

with f:
    f.post(on='/random_work', inputs=Document(), on_done=print)
```

````

`````

## Single Python file

When you are only working with a single python file (let's call it `my_executor.py`), you can simply put it at the root of the repository, and import it directly in `config.yml`

```yaml
jtype: MyExecutor
metas:
  py_modules:
    - my_executor.py
```

## Multiple Python files

When you are working with multiple python files, you should organize them as a **Python package** and put them in a special folder inside
your repository (as you would normally do with Python packages). Specifically, you should do the following:

- put all your Python files inside a special folder (call it `executor`, as a convention), and put an `__init__.py` file inside it
  - because of how Jina registers executors, make sure to import your executor in this file (see the contents of `executor/__init__.py` in the example below).
- use relative imports (`from .bar import foo`, and not `from bar import foo`) inside the python modules in this folder
- Only list `executor/__init__.py` under `py_modules` in `config.yml` - this way Python knows that you are importing a package, and makes sure that all the relative imports within your package work properly

To make things more specific, take this repository structure as an example:

```
.
├── config.yml
└── executor
    ├── helper.py
    ├── __init__.py
    └── my_executor.py
```

The contents of `executor/__init__.py` is

```python
from .my_executor import MyExecutor
```

the contents of `executor/helper.py` is

```python
def print_something():
    print('something')
```

and the contents of `executor/my_executor.py` is

```python
from jina import Executor, requests

from .helper import print_something

class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, **kwargs):
        print_something()
```

Finally, the contents of `config.yml` - notice that only the `executor/__init__.py` file needs to be listed under `py_modules`

```yaml
jtype: MyExecutor
metas:
  py_modules:
    - executor/__init__.py
```

This was a relatively simple example, but this way of structuring python modules works for any python package structure, however complex. Consider this slightly more complicated example

```
.
├── config.yml           # Remains exactly the same as before
└── executor
    ├── helper.py
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── my_executor.py
    └── utils/
        ├── __init__.py  # Required inside all executor sub-folders
        ├── data.py
        └── io.py
```

Here you can then import from `utils/data.py` in `my_executor.py` like this: `from .utils.data import foo`, and do any other kinds of relative imports that python enables.

The best thing is that no matter how complicated your package structure, "importing" it in your `config.yml` file is super easy - you always put only `executor/__init__.py` under `py_modules`.

```{hint}

For a remote Executor used with JinaD, please read the guidelines about [uploading files to remote](../../advanced/daemon/remote-executors.md#file-structures-with-remote-executors).
