# On Windows

You can install and use Jina on Windows.

However, Jina is built keeping *nix-based platforms in mind, and the upstream libraries that Jina depends on also follow the similar ideology. Hence, there are some caveats when running Jina on Windows. [If you face additional issues, please let us know.](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/issues/)

```{caution}
There can be a significant performance impact while running Jina on Windows. You may not want to use it in production.
```

```{tip}
Alternatively, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux for better compatibility. Check the official guide [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
Make sure you install WSL**2**.
Once done, you can install Jina as on a native *nix platform.
```

## Known issues

### `multiprocessing spawn`

Jina relies heavily on `multiprocessing` to enable scaling & distribution. Windows only supports [spawn start method for multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#the-spawn-and-forkserver-start-methods), which has a few caveats. [Please follow the guidelines here.](../../../fundamentals/flow/remarks#multiprocessing-spawn)

### Compatibility of Executors in the Hub

We've added preliminary support for using Executors listed in the Hub portal. Note that, these Executors are based on *nix OS and might not be compatible to run natively on Windows. Containers that are built on Windows are not yet supported.

```

### `UnicodeEncodeError` on Jina CLI

```bash
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u25ae' in position : character maps to <undefined>
```
Set environment variable `PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'` before starting your Python script.
