    Helper class to expose common interface to the traversal logic of the BaseExecutable Driver.

    traversing to ensure that then the driver can be applied at a comparable level of granularity and adjacency.
    This does not imply that you can't compare at the end a document with 10 matches with a groundtruth with 20 matches
