# Creating a Remote Jina Pod from Flow APIs with jinad
A common case of using Jina remotely is to have a Flow running locally with some pods on the remote. 

## Prerequisites
Before the start, make sure you have read the [prerequisites for using jinad](https://docs.jina.ai/chapters/remote/jinad.html#prerequisites)

## Steps
In the following codes, we create a Flow on the locale with two Pods. One of the Pods is set to be running on the remote. After building the Flow, we send one index request with two Documents to it.

```python
from jina import Flow
f = (Flow()
     .add(uses='_logforward')
     .add(uses='_logforward', host='3.16.166.3', port_expose=8000))
with f:
    f.index_lines(lines=['hello', 'jina'])
```

As shown in the logs below, `pod1` is running on the remote while `gateway` and `pod0` are running locally. `jinad` manages the creating and deleting of the `pod1` on the remote.
