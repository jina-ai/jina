For more details, please see the<br>`Executor cookbook <https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/executor/executor-files/>`__ | `array` | `None` |
| `port` | The port for input data to bind to, default is a random port between [49152, 65535]. In the case of an external Executor (`--external` or `external=True`) this can be a list of ports, separated by commas.

| `volumes` | The path on the host to be mounted inside the container. <br><br>Note, <br>- If separated by `:`, then the first part will be considered as the local host path and the second part is the path in the container system. <br>- If no split provided, then the basename of that directory will be mounted into container's root path, e.g. `--volumes="/user/test/my-workspace"` will be mounted into `/my-workspace` inside the container. <br>- All volumes are mounted with read-write mode. | `array` | `None` |
| `gpus` | This argument allows dockerized Jina executor discover local gpu devices.<br><br>    Note, <br>    - To access all gpus, use `--gpus all`.<br>    - To access multiple gpus, e.g. make use of 2 gpus, use `--gpus 2`.<br>    - To access specified gpus based on device id, use `--gpus device=[YOUR-GPU-DEVICE-ID]`<br>    - To access specified gpus based on multiple device id, use `--gpus device=[YOUR-GPU-DEVICE-ID1],device=[YOUR-GPU-DEVICE-ID2]`<br>    - To specify more parameters, use `--gpus device=[YOUR-GPU-DEVICE-ID],runtime=nvidia,capabilities=display | `string` | `None` |

| `host` | The host address of the runtime, by default it is 0.0.0.0. In the case of an external Executor (`--external` or `external=True`) this can be a list of hosts, separated by commas. Then, every resulting address will be considered as one replica of the Executor. | `string` | `0.0.0.0` |
| `quiet_remote_logs` | Do not display the streaming of remote logs on local console | `boolean` | `False` |
| `upload_files` | The files on the host to be uploaded to the remote<br>workspace. This can be useful when your Deployment has more<br>file dependencies beyond a single YAML file, e.g.<br>Python files, data files.<br><br>Note,<br>- currently only flatten structure is supported, which means if you upload `[./foo/a.py, ./foo/b.pp, ./bar/c.yml]`, then they will be put under the _same_ workspace on the remote, losing all hierarchies.<br>- by default, `--uses` YAML file is always uploaded.<br>- uploaded files are by default isolated across the runs. To ensure files are submitted to the same workspace across different runs, use `--workspace-id` to specify the workspace. | `array` | `None` |
