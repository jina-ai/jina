# Before you start

Before you jump in to any tutorials, we recommend you do the following:

## Understand Jina

Read through an {ref}`introduction to Jina concepts <architecture-overview>` to understand the basic components that will be used in the tutorial.

## Work in a virtual environment

We highly recommend you work in [a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to prevent conflicts in packaging versions. This applies not just to Jina, but Python as a whole.

## Install Jina

For most purposes, you can install Jina with:

```shell
pip install jina
```

For more installation options, see {ref}`our installation guide <install>`.

## Python vs YAML

Jina supports YAML in many circumstances for easier deployment. For more information, see our {ref}`guide on coding in Python and YAML in Jina <python-yaml>`.
