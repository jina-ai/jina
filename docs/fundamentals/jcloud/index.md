After building a Jina project, the next step is to deploy and host it on the cloud. JCloud simplifies deploying and hosting your Jina projects on Jina Cloud. It provides a simple CLI with five commands to manage the life cycle of your Jina projects.

```{tip}
At present, Jina Cloud hosts all your Jina projects and offers computational/storage resources **for free**!
```

## Basics

Jina Cloud provides a CLI that you can use via `jina cloud` from the terminal (or `jcloud` or simply `jc` for minimalists.)


````{hint}
You can also install just the Jina Cloud CLI without installing the Jina package.

```bash
pip install jcloud
jc -h
```

If you installed JCloud individually, all of its commands fall under the `jc` or `jcloud` executable.


In case the command `jc` is already occupied by another tool, use `jcloud` instead. If your pip install doesn't register bash commands for you, you can run `python -m jcloud -h`.
````

For the rest of this section, we use `jc` or `jcloud`. But again they are interchangable with `jina cloud`.


### Log in

```bash
jc login
```

You can use a Google or GitHub account to register and log in. For all the next steps, logging in is mandatory.

If you have no access to a web browser in your integration environment, you can set the Environment Variable `JINA_AUTH_TOKEN` using an authentication token before working with JCloud. Authentication tokens can be generated by user login or Personal Access Token (PAT) creation. Please visit [jina-auth](https://github.com/jina-ai/auth) for more information (`jc` already includes `jina-auth`.)

### Deploy

In Jina's idiom, a project is a [Flow](https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/flow/), which represents an end-to-end task such as indexing, searching or recommending. In this document, we use "project" and "Flow" interchangeably.

```{caution}
Flows have a maximum {ref}`lifetime<jcloud-lifetime>` after which they are automatically deleted.
```

A Flow can have two types of file structure: a single YAML file or a project folder.

#### Single YAML file

A self-contained YAML file, consisting of all configuration at the [Flow](https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/flow/)-level and [Executor](https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/executor/)-level.

> All Executors' `uses` must follow the format `jinahub+docker://MyExecutor` (from [Jina Hub](https://hub.jina.ai)) to avoid any local file dependencies:

```yaml
# flow.yml
jtype: Flow
executors:
  - name: sentencizer
    uses: jinahub+docker://Sentencizer
```

To deploy:

```bash
jc deploy flow.yml
```

````{tip}
We recommend testing locally before deployment:

```bash
jina flow --uses flow.yml
```
````


#### Project folder

````{tip}
The best practice of creating a JCloud project is to use:

```
jc new
```

This ensures the correct project structure accepted by JCloud.
````

Just like a regular Python project, you can have sub-folders of Executor implementations and a `flow.yml` on the top-level to connect all Executors together.

You can create an example local project using `jc new hello`. The default structure looks like:

```
hello/
├── .env
├── executor1
│   ├── config.yml
│   ├── executor.py
│   └── requirements.txt
└── flow.yml
```

Where:

- `hello/` is your top-level project folder.
- `executor1` directory has all Executor related code/configuration. You can read the best practices for [file structures](https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/executor/executor-files/). Multiple Executor directories can be created.
- `flow.yml` Your Flow YAML.
- `.env` All environment variables used during deployment.

To deploy:

```bash
jc deploy hello
```

The Flow is successfully deployed when you see:

```{figure} deploy.png
:width: 70%
```

You will get a Flow ID, say `173503c192`. This ID is required to manage, view logs and remove the Flow.

As this Flow is deployed with the default gRPC gateway (feel free to change it to `http` or `websocket`), you can use `jina.Client` to access it:

```python
from jina import Client, Document

c = Client(host='https://173503c192.wolf.jina.ai')
print(c.post('/', Document(text='hello')))
```

### View logs

To watch the logs in real time:

```bash
jc logs 173503c192
```

You can also stream logs for a particular Executor by passing its name:

```bash
jc logs 173503c192 --executor sentencizer
```

### Remove Flows

You can remove a single Flow, multiple Flows or even all Flows by passing different identifiers.

To remove a single Flow:

```bash
jc remove 173503c192
```

To remove multiple Flows:

```bash
jc remove 173503c192 887f6313e5 ddb8a2c4ef
```

To remove all Flows:

```bash
jc remove all
```

By default, removing multiple or all Flows is an interactive process where you must give confirmation before each Flow is deleted. To make it non-interactive, set the below environment variable before running the command:

```bash
export JCLOUD_NO_INTERACTIVE=1
```

### Get status

To get the status of a Flow:
```bash
jc status 15937a10bd
```

```{figure} status.png
:width: 70%
```

### Monitoring

Basic monitoring is provided to Flows deployed on JCloud.

To access the [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)-powered dashboard, first get {ref}`the status of the Flow<jcloud-flow-status>`. The `dashboards` link is displayed at the bottom of the pane. Visit the URL to find basic metrics like 'Number of Request Gateway Received' and 'Time elapsed between receiving a request and sending back the response':

```{figure} monitoring.png
:width: 70%
```

### List Flows

To list all of your "ALIVE" Flows:

```bash
jc list
```

```{figure} list.png
:width: 70%
```

You can also filter your Flows by passing a status:

```bash
jc list --status FAILED
```


```{figure} list_failed.png
:width: 70%
```

Or see all Flows:

```bash
jc list --status ALL
```

```{figure} list_all.png
:width: 70%
```

### Pass environment variables

#### Single YAML

```bash
jc deploy flow.yml --env-file flow.env
```

#### Project folder

- You can include your environment variables in the `.env` file in the local project and JCloud manages them.
- You can optionally pass a `custom.env`.
  ```bash
  jc deploy ./hello --env-file ./hello/custom.env
  ```
  
## Troubleshooting

If your deployment failed, enable verbose logging and redeploy it. You can add `--loglevel DEBUG` _before_ each CLI subcommand:

```bash
jc --loglevel DEBUG deploy flow.yml
```

Alternatively, you can configure it by using environment variable `JCLOUD_LOGLEVEL`:

```bash
JCLOUD_LOGLEVEL=DEBUG jc deploy flow.yml
```

If you don't see any obvious errors, please raise an issue in [the JCloud repository](https://github.com/jina-ai/jcloud/issues/new/choose).

## Restrictions

JCloud scales according to your needs. You can demand different resources (GPU/RAM/CPU/storage/instance-capacity) based on the needs of your Flows and Executors. If you have specific resource requirements, please contact us [on Slack](https://jina.ai/slack) or raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jina-ai/jcloud/issues/new/choose).


```{admonition} Restrictions
  
- Deployments are only supported in the `us-east` region.
- Each Executor is allocated a maximum of 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores & 10GB of block storage.
- Three Flows can be deployed at a time, out of which one Flow can use a GPU.
- A maximum of two GPUs are allocated per Flow.
- Flows with Executors using GPU are removed after 12 hours, whereas other Flows are removed after 72 hours.
```
