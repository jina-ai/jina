# Readiness

An Orchestration is marked as "ready", when:
- Its Executor is fully loaded and ready (in the case of a Deployment)
- All its Executors and Gateway are fully loaded and ready
 
After that, an Orchestration is able to process requests.

{class}`~jina.Client` offers an API to query these readiness endpoints. You can do this via the Orchestration directly, via the Client, or via the CLI: You can call {meth}`~jina.clients.mixin.HealthCheckMixin.is_flow_ready` or {meth}`~jina.Flow.is_flow_ready`. It returns `True` if the Flow is ready, and `False` if it is not.

## Via Orchestration

````{tab} Deployment
```python
from jina import Deployment

dep = Deployment()

with dep:
    print(dep.is_deployment_ready())

print(dep.is_deployment_ready())
```
```text
True
False
```
````
````{tab} Flow
```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow.add()

with f:
    print(f.is_flow_ready())

print(f.is_flow_ready())
```
```text
True
False
```
````

## Via Jina Client

````{tab} Deployment
```python
from jina import Deployment

dep = Deployment(port=12345)

with dep:
    dep.block()
```
```python
from jina import Client

client = Client(port=12345)
print(client.is_deployment_ready())
```
```text
True
```
````
````{tab} Flow
```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow(port=12345).add()

with f:
    f.block()
```
```python
from jina import Client

client = Client(port=12345)
print(client.is_flow_ready())
```
```text

### Via CLI

`````{tab} Deployment
```python

## Readiness check via third-party clients

You can check the status of a Flow using any gRPC/HTTP/WebSockets client, not just via Jina Client.

To see how this works, first instantiate the Flow with its corresponding protocol and block it for serving:

```python
from jina import Flow
import os

PROTOCOL = 'grpc'  # it could also be http or websocket

os.environ[
    'JINA_LOG_LEVEL'
] = 'DEBUG'  # this way we can check what is the PID of the Executor

with Flow(protocol=PROTOCOL, port=12345).add() as f:
    f.block()
```

### Using gRPC

When using grpc, use [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) to access the Gateway's gRPC service that is responsible for reporting the Flow status.

```shell
docker pull fullstorydev/grpcurl:latest
docker run --network='host' fullstorydev/grpcurl -plaintext 127.0.0.1:12345 jina.JinaGatewayDryRunRPC/dry_run
```
The error-free output below signifies a correctly running Flow:
```json
{}
```

You can simulate an Executor going offline by killing its process.

```shell script
kill -9 $EXECUTOR_PID # in this case we can see in the logs that it is 19059
```

Then by doing the same check, you can see that it returns an error:

```shell
docker run --network='host' fullstorydev/grpcurl -plaintext 127.0.0.1:12345 jina.JinaGatewayDryRunRPC/dry_run
```

### Using HTTP or WebSockets

When using HTTP or WebSockets as the Gateway protocol, use curl to target the `/dry_run` endpoint and get the status of the Flow.


```shell
curl http://localhost:12345/dry_run
```
Error-free output signifies a correctly running Flow:
```json
{"code":0,"description":"","exception":null}
```

You can simulate an Executor going offline by killing its process:

```shell script
kill -9 $EXECUTOR_PID # in this case we can see in the logs that it is 19059
```

Then by doing the same check, you can see that the call returns an error:

```json
{"code":1,"description":"failed to connect to all addresses |Gateway: Communication error with deployment executor0 at address(es) {'0.0.0.0:12346'}. Head or worker(s) may be down.","exception":{"name":"InternalNetworkError","args":["failed to connect to all addresses |Gateway: Communication error with deployment executor0 at address(es) {'0.0.0.0:12346'}.
