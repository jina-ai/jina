# Create Executor

To create your Hub Executor, you just need to run this command in your terminal:

```bash
jina hub new
```
````{admonition} Note
:class: note
A `Hub Executor` is an executor that is published in JinaHub. Such an executor can be easily used in a flow like this:
```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add(uses='jinahub+docker://MyExecutor')
``` 
We'll discuss more how to use hub executors in this {ref}`section <use-hub-executor>`
````
When you run the command above, a wizard will ask you some questions about the Executor. For the basic configuration, 
you will be asked two things: The Executor’s name and where it should be saved. The wizard will ask if you want to have 
a more advanced configuration, but it is unnecessary for most of use cases.

After running the command, a project with the following structure will be generated:

```text
MyExecutor/
├── Dockerfile	        # Advanced configuration will generate this file
├── manifest.yml
├── config.yml
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── executor.py
```

- `manifest.yml` should contain the annotations of the Executor for getting better appealing on Jina Hub.
- `config.yml` is the config file of your Executor. You can define **__init__** arguments using **with** keyword in this config file.
- `requirements.txt` describes the Python dependencies of the Executor.
- `executor.py` should contain the main logic of your Executor.
- `README.md` should describe the usage of the Executor.
