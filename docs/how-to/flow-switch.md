# Add selection control to a Flow

````{admonition} Requirements
:class: hint
To follow along with this How-To, you need Jina 3.2.2 or higher.
````

In this tutorial you will gain a deeper insight into the {class}`~jina.Flow` 's {ref}`filter condition feature<flow-filter>`.

In a nutshell, this feature allows every {class}`~jina.Executor` in a Flow do define a filter that can only be passed by Documents that
fulfill a specified `condition`.

If you are not yet familiar with the basics of the [DocArray query language](https://docarray.jina.ai/fundamentals/documentarray/find/#query-by-conditions) and how it is used to create
{ref}`filters <flow-filter>`, we recommend that you read the linked documentation pages first.
````

Here you will learn where and how to use this feature, and how you can build *selection control* into your Flow.

## Why do you need a selection control?

{ref}`As you know <flow-complex-topologies>`, Jina Flows can define complex topologies that include multiple Executors,
both in sequence and on parallel branches.

A simple Flow with parallel branches could be defined like so:

```python
from jina import Flow

f = (
    Flow()
    .add(name='start_exec')
    .add(name='exec1', needs='start_exec')
    .add(name='exec2', needs='start_exec')
    .needs_all()
)
f.plot()
```

```{figure} simple-parallel-flow.svg
:width: 70%
:align: center
Flow with two parallel branches.
```

A topology like this means that the Documents do not get processed by `exec1` before they go to `exec2`, and vice vers.
However, all Documents still go through all branches and all Executors.

In some scenarios, you might not want all Documents to be processed by all Executors, for example when you index Documents
representing different kinds of data, like text and images.

One way to achieve this differentiation is to use different Executor endpoints:

    .needs_all()
)

text_data = DocumentArray([Document(text='hey there!') for _ in range(2)])
image_data = DocumentArray(
    [Document(tensor=np.random.rand(2, 2)) for _ in range(2)]
)  # dummy images
with f:
    embedded_texts = f.post(inputs=text_data, on='/index-text')
    print(embedded_texts[:, 'tags'])
    print(embedded_texts.embeddings)
    print('---------')
    embedded_images = f.post(inputs=image_data, on='/index-images')
    print(embedded_images[:, 'tags'])
    print(embedded_images.embeddings)
```

from docarray import DocumentArray, Document
from jina import Executor, requests
import numpy as np


class TextIndexer(Executor):
    @requests(on='/index-text')
    def index(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        docs.embeddings = np.random.rand(len(docs), 3)  # dummy embeddings
        for doc in docs:
            doc.tags['embedded_by'] = 'textIndexer'


class ImageIndexer(Executor):
    @requests(on='/index-images')
    def index(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        docs.embeddings = np.random.rand(len(docs), 3)  # dummy embeddings
        for doc in docs:
            doc.tags['embedded_by'] = 'imageIndexer'
```
````

```console
[{'embedded_by': 'textIndexer'}, {'embedded_by': 'textIndexer'}]
[[0.37511057 0.14902827 0.31666838]
 [0.18466062 0.17823904 0.20046065]]
---------
[{'embedded_by': 'imageIndexer'}, {'embedded_by': 'imageIndexer'}]
[[0.37511057 0.14902827 0.31666838]
 [0.18466062 0.17823904 0.20046065]]
```

As you can see, the image data was only processed by the `ImageIndexer`, and the text data was only processed by the `TextIndexer`.

However, there is a problem with this approach:
Sometimes you can't easily control the endpoints of all Executors, for example when you are using the {ref}`Jina Hub <jina-hub>` or {ref}`external Executors <external-executor>`.

To solve that problem, you can leverage filter condition to easily add selection control into your Flow.

## Define the filter conditions

In a Jina Flow, you can use the [DocArray query language](https://docarray.jina.ai/fundamentals/documentarray/find/#query-by-conditions) to specify a filter condition for every
Executor.

To do this, you pass a condition to the `when` parameter in `flow.add()`:

```python
from jina import Flow

f = Flow().add(when={'tags__key': {'$eq': 5}})
```

Then, Documents that do not satisfy the `when` condition will not reach the associated Executor.

In the use case where you are trying to separate Documents according to the data modality they hold, you need to choose
a condition accordingly.

````{admonition} See Also
:class: seealso

In addition to `$exists` you can use a number of other operators to define your filter: `$eq`, `$gte`, `$lte`, `$size`,
`$and`, `$or` and many more. For details, consult this [DocArray documentation page](https://docarray.jina.ai/fundamentals/documentarray/find/#query-by-conditions).
````

```python
# define filter conditions
text_condition = {'text': {'$exists': True}}
tensor_condition = {'tensor': {'$exists': True}}
```

These conditions specify that only Documents that hold data of a specific modality can pass the filter.

### Try the filters outside the Flow

You can try the conditions directly on your data, outside the Flow:

```python
filtered_text_data = data.find(text_condition)
filtered_image_data = data.find(tensor_condition)

print(filtered_text_data.texts)  # print text
print('---')
print(filtered_image_data.tensors)
```
```console
['hey there!', 'hey there!']
---
[[[0.50535537 0.50538128]
  [0.40446746 0.34972967]]

 [[0.04222604 0.70102327]
  [0.12079661 0.65313938]]]
```

As you can see, each filter selects the Documents that contain the desired data fields.
That's exactly what you want for your filter!

## Build the Flow

Finally, you can assemble your Flow using these conditions and the Indexers from above.
This time there is no need to choose different Executor endpoints for the Indexers, since the filters take care of the
selection control logic.

````{tab} Flow

```{code-block} python

from jina import Flow

f = (
    Flow()
    .add(name='start_exec')
    .add(
        name='ImageIndexer',
        uses=ImageIndexer,
        needs='start_exec',
        when={'tensor': {'$exists': True}},
    )
    .add(
        name='TextIndexer',
        uses=TextIndexer,
        needs='start_exec',
        when={'text': {'$exists': True}},
    )
    .needs_all()
)
```
````

````{tab} Executors

```{code-block} python
---
emphasize-lines: 7, 15
---
from docarray import DocumentArray, Document
from jina import Executor, requests
import numpy as np


class TextIndexer(Executor):
    @requests(on='/index')
    def index(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        docs.embeddings = np.random.rand(len(docs), 3)  # dummy embeddings
        for doc in docs:
            doc.tags['embedded_by'] = 'textIndexer'


class ImageIndexer(Executor):
    @requests(on='/index')
    def index(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        docs.embeddings = np.random.rand(len(docs), 3)  # dummy embeddings
        for doc in docs:
            doc.tags['embedded_by'] = 'imageIndexer'
```
````

Here you simply tell each Executor to filter its inputs according to the conditions that you specified above:
Text and image data should be treated separately.

## Index the data

If you now send your data to the Flow, you expect that only your image data will be sent to `ImageIndexer`, and only your
text data will be sent to `TextIndexer`.

Let's take a look:

```python
with f:
    embedded_docs = f.post(on='/index', inputs=data)

embedded_by = embedded_docs[:, 'tags__embedded_by']
texts = embedded_docs.texts
tensors = embedded_docs.tensors
for embedded_by, text, image in list(zip(embedded_by, texts, tensors)):
    print(f'Embedded by: {embedded_by}; Text: {text}, Image: {image}')
```

```console
Embedded by: textIndexer; Text: hey there!, Image: None
Embedded by: textIndexer; Text: hey there!, Image: None
Embedded by: imageIndexer; Text: , Image: [[0.60863086 0.39863197], [0.78668579 0.66100752]]
Embedded by: imageIndexer; Text: , Image: [[0.78359225 0.75458748], [0.56896536 0.66725426]]
```

And indeed, that's exactly what happens!

The Documents that have a text were processed by `TextIndexer`, and the Documents that contain an image were processed by `ImageIndexer`.
And remember, with this solution the Documents don't even get *sent* to the incorrect Executor.

## What's next

Now that you know how to use filter conditions to add selection control, you can leverage this feature to build all kinds of business logic.

You could differentiate between more than just two different data modalities, you could direct requests based on the Client they come from,
ignore Documents that don't meet certain quality criteria, or route data to specialized Executors based on what the data
itself looks like. Your imagination is the limit!
