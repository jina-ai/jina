# Welcome to Jina!

Jina is a neural search framework that allows anyone to build SOTA & scalable deep learning search applications in minutes.

1. Make sure that you have Python 3.7+ installed on Linux/MacOS.
2. Install Jina: ``pip install jina``
3. Run hello-world demos: ``jina hello fashion``
4. That’s it! In the next few seconds the demo will open in a new page in your browser.

Now that you’re set up, let’s dive into more of how Jina works and how to build great apps.
