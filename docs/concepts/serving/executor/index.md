# Executor

An {class}`~jina.Executor` is a self-contained microservice that performs a task on `Documents`. 

You can create an Executor by extending the `Executor` class and adding logic to endpoint methods.

## Why use Executors?

Once you've learned about `Documents` and `DocList` from [docarray](https://docs.docarray.org/), you can use all its power and expressiveness to build a multimodal application.
But what if you want to go bigger? Organize your code into modules, serve and scale them independently as microservices? That's where Executors come in.

- Executors let you organize functions into logical entities that can share configuration state, following OOP.
- Executors can be easily containerized and shared with your colleagues using `jina hub push/pull`.
- Executors can be exposed as a service over gRPC using `~jina.Deployment`.
- Executors can be chained together to form a `~jina.Flow`.

## Minimum working example

```python
from jina import Executor, requests, Deployment
from docarray import DocList
from docarray.documents import TextDoc


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, docs: DocList[TextDoc], **kwargs) -> DocList[TextDoc]:
        for d in docs:
            d.text = 'hello world'
        return docs


with Deployment(uses=MyExecutor) as dep:
    response_docs = dep.post(on='/', inputs=DocList[TextDoc]([TextDoc(text='hello')]), return_type=DocList[TextDoc])
    print(f'Text: {response_docs[0].text}')
```
